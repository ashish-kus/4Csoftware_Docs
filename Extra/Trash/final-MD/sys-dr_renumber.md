## sys.dr_renumber()
### Purpose
`sys.dr_renumber()` allows the user to renumber sequenced lines in a scrolling program.

### Usage
```c
sys.dr_renumber();
```

### Arguments
None

### Returns
0 - OK

-1 - Invalid state to allow renumbering.

### Where Used
`sys.dr_renumber()` should only be called by an application that catches `<xlrenumber>` and has determined that renumbering can proceed. Most applications will have no need for this and can just specify that renumbering is allowed in the program file definition.

### Example
The bootstrap program `sys.df.fm.pnl` catches `<xlrenumber>` and prevents renumbering if screen panels are locked or the program is readonly. Otherwise, it allows renumbering by calling `sys.dr_renumber()`.

### Description
A scrolling program that needs to sometimes allow renumbering and sometimes prevent it at runtime can do so by catching `<xlrenumber>` and in the processing of `<xlrenumber>` call `sys.dr_renumber()` if it wants renumbering to proceed. To prevent renumbering, it just avoids calling `sys.dr_number()`.

### Bugs / Features / Comments
This is a fairly specialized SysPCL. Be sure your application needs it before using it.
