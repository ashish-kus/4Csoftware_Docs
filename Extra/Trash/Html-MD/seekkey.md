sys.seek_key()

### sys.seek_key()

Purpose:

sys.seek_key() prepares for sequential reading by seeking to either the
start or end key position.

Usage:

ret = sys.seek_key(\<asfile\>,\<keyno\>,\<seektype\>);

Arguments:

\<asfile\> - asfile

integer \<keyno\> - An integer returned by a call to sys.get_keyno()

integer \<seektype\> - Either SEEK_START or SEEK_END

Returns:

0 - OK

-1 - Some Error

Where Used:

sys.seek_key() will typically be called after calls to sys.set_skey()
and sys.set_ekey() and before calling sys.read_file(...,F_SEQNEXT)

Example:

See the demo.seekkey.1 demo program for an example.

Description:

sys.seek_key() prepares a file for reading sequentially. If the start
key set by a call to sys.set_skey() is greater than the end key set by a
call to sys.set_skey(), or if the \<seektype\> is SEEK_END,
sys.seek_key() reverses the meaning of F_SEQNEXT and F_SEQPREV for
sequential reads that follow. You almost always should use F_SEQNEXT
when reading a file sequentially after a call to sys.seek_key().\
\
F_DRNEXT and F_DRPREV can be used in place of F_SEQNEXT and F_SEQPREV
and are better alternatives because you do not need to specify the key
that you are reading by. They will always use the key specified in the
\<keyno\> arg.

Bugs/Features/Comments:

When using sys.seek_key() on secondary keys, you still need to specify
the keyno in calls to sys.read_file(...,F_SEQNEXT) So use F_DRNEXT and
F_DRPREV instead.\
\
Be very careful using F_SEQPREV after calling sys.seek_key(). It may
actually read the next rcd rather than the previous.
