sys.end_fldloop()

### sys.end_fldloop()

Purpose:

sys.end_fldloop() ends the current iteration of fields.

Usage:

sys.end_fldloop();

Arguments:

None

Returns:

0 - sys.end_fldloop() always returns 0.

Where Used:

sys.end_fldloop() should only be called somewhere within the 4C fld
processing states. This can be anytime after the StartFieldLoop and
before the end of the EndFieldLoop.

Example:

/\* End Fld PCL for atype - if atype == 'A' then don't process any more
fields\
\
The sys.end_fldloop() call causes control to go straight to the Efldlp
PCL without processing any more fields.\
\
We could also have set sys.next_field = 9999 and then called
sys.exit_field(). The only difference would be if this were a scrolling
program, then no more iterations would be processed either. \*/\
if (atype == "A") sys.end_fldloop();

Description:

sys.end_fldloop() will end the current iteration of the fld loop. The
EFldLp PCL WILL be executed.\
\
The current executing PCL and all nested PCLs will terminate without
processing any more statements.\
\
If the program is a scrolling program in Add, Modify, or Delete mode,
then no more iterations will be processed. Control will return to the
Epage PCL for Modify mode, and to the Spage PCL for Delete and Add
modes.\
\
The difference between sys.end_fldloop() and sys.exit_fldloop() is that
the EFldlp PCL will be executed for sys.end_fldloop(), and will not be
executed for sys.exit_fldloop().\
\
sys.end_fldloop() can be called from the Sfldlp PCL or any Fld PCL. It
cannot be called from the Efldlp PCL because it will cause looping. If
it is called from any other PCL, the results are unpredictable.

Bugs/Features/Comments:

4C does not check to see if the program is in a state that allows ending
of the field loop. If you are not, the results are unpredictablre.
