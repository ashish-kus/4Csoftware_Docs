sys.share_field()

### sys.share_field()

Purpose:

sys.share_field() allow you to set up sharing of fields at run time.

Usage:

ret = sys.share_field(\<field1\>,\<field2\>);

Arguments:

\<field1\> - Any field in the program

\<field2\> - Any field in the program\
\
Note: \<field1\> and \<field2\> are passed by name, not by cdefine or by
dpy field label. Any data type is allowed, but they both must be
compatible to allow sharing.

Returns:

0 - OK

-1 - Field Data Types not compatible for sharing

Where Used:

sys.share_field() can be called from anywhere. However, since fields
cannot be unshared, it is most useful in the Init PCL.

Example:

Description:

sys.share_field() allows you to set up field sharing at run time for
fields within the same program. If you know ahead of time which fields
will be shared, it is better to use the local field sharing definition.
However, if it is not known until run time which fields will be shared,
then this PCL can be used. This PCL always causes Full Sharing.
