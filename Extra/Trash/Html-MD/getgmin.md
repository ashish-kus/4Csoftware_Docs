sys.get_gmin()

### sys.get_gmin()

Purpose:

Return Grand Min Val\
\
sys.get_gmin() returns the current grand min val of a CB TOT Var for the
CB EOF Group for a particular CB.

Usage:


    min = sys.get_gmin(<cbtot>);
    min = sys.get_gmin(<CBNAME>,<cbtot>);



              Or more generally



    min = sys.get_gmin([<CBNAME>,]<cbtot>);

\
\
In most cases, sys.get_gmin() will be used with one argument. When used
this way, it will work with the current CB.\
\
Optional arguments are allowed so that you can get grand min vals
without needing to be processing a particular CB.

Arguments:

\<CBNAME\> - The name of the CB that you need to get a min val for. This
is an optional argument. If it is not passed, then sys.get_gmin() uses
the current CB.

\<cbtot\> - The name of the CB TOT Var to return the grand min val for.
This argument must always be specified.

Returns: sys.get_gmin() can return alpha, integer or float. Since any
value is valid for a min, there is no way to return a unique bad value,
however sys.get_gmin() will try to return a bad value when necessary. A
bad return for an alpha is the NULL string, or "". A bad return for a
float is -1.0, and a bad ret for an integer is -1. Thus the following
may be considered bad returns sometimes, but they could also be
perfectly valid.\
\

"" - OR

-1.0 - OR

-1 - Either \<CBNAME\> or \<cbtot\> is invalid.

AnyValue - The current grand min of the CB TOT Var for specified CB.

Where Used:

sys.get_gmin() can be called from anywhere as long as there is an active
driver with \<CBNAME\> set appropriately to either CB_DRPROC or
CB_DRSEL.

Example:

The following example gets the current grand min value for the CB TOT
Var sys.pr_syssize for the current CB.\
\
min = sys.get_gmin(sys.pr_syssize);

Description:

sys.get_gmin() returns the current min val of a CB TOT Var for a CB EOF
Group for a particular CB. This is called the grand min of the TOT Var
for the CB. It can be called with 1 or 2 arguments.\
\
If called with 1 arg, the arg is \<cbtot\>. sys.get_gmin() will return
the current grand min val of the CB TOT Var for the Current CB.\
\
If used with 2 args, the args are \<CBNAME\> and \<cbtot\>.
sys.get_gmin() will return the current grand min val of the CB TOT Var
for the specified CB. You may want to use sys.get_gmin() in this manner
if you need to access a grand min val of a particular CB outside of
current CB processing.\
\
Thus, you can get any CB TOT Var grand min val for any currently active
CB from any PCL.\
\
4C maintains grand min values for each CB TOT Var that was defined as
MIN. The Grand Min Val of a CB TOT Var is the same as the Min Val of the
CB TOT Var for the CB EOF Group. This value is updated at the same time
that totals are updated. That is, the grand min value is updated after
the rcd has been CB Selected and before running the DRSELECT or DRPROC
PCL. The grand min vals are never reset to null.
