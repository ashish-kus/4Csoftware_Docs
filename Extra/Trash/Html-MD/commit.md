sys.commit()

### sys.commit()

Purpose:

sys.commit() commits a 4C transaction.

Usage:

ret = sys.commit(\<tname\>);

Arguments:

alpha \<tname\> - A program specific name for the transaction. This name
must be the same used that started the transaction.

Returns:

0 - Transaction committed

-1 - Either the transaction specified by \<tname\> does not exist or the
transaction was aborted. Check sys.errno for ABORT_ERR. Transactions may
be aborted due to deadlock situations.

Where Used:

sys.commit() can be called from anywhere, but it can only commit a
transaction started within the same 4c program.\
\
When possible you should try to use sys.commit() within the same PCL
that called sys.begin().

Example:

See [sys.begin()](./begin.html) for example code.

Description:

sys.commit() commits the transaction specified by \<tname\> as well as
any nested transactions. Only explicit transactions started by the
application can be committed by the application and the transaction must
have been started by the same 4C program that calls sys.commit(). You
cannot start transaction, "T1", in programA, push ProgramB and commit
the transaction, "T1", in progranB.
