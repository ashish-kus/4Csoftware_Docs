sys.get_max()

### sys.get_max()

Purpose:

sys.get_max() returns the current max val of a CB TOT Var for a CB
Var/EOF Group for a particular CB.

Usage:


    max = sys.get_max(<cbtot>);
    max = sys.get_max(<cbvar>,<cbtot>);
    max = sys.get_max(<CBNAME>,<cbvar>,<cbtot>);



              Or more generally



    max = sys.get_max([[<CBNAME>,]<cbvar>,]<cbtot>);

\
\
In most cases, sys.get_max() will be used with one argument. When used
this way, it will work with the current CB and the current CB Var/EOF
Group.\
\
Optional arguments are allowed so that you can get max vals without
needing to be processing a particular CB Var Group or even a particular
CB.

Arguments:

\<CBNAME\> - The name of the CB that you need to get a max val for. This
is an optional argument. If it is not passed, then sys.get_max() uses
the current CB. If it is passed, then the \<cbvar\> argument must also
be passed.

\<cbvar\> - The fldname that defines the CB Var Group that you want the
max val for. This is an optional argument as long as the \<CBNAME\>
argument is not used. If \<cbvar\> is not used, then sys.get_max()
assumes the current CB Var/EOF Group for the current CB.

\<cbtot\> - The name of the CB TOT Var to return the max val for. This
argument must always be specified.

Returns: sys.get_max() can return alpha, integer or float. Since any
value is valid for a max, there is no way to return a unique bad value,
however sys.get_max() will try to return a bad value when necessary. A
bad return for an alpha is the NULL string, or "". A bad return for a
float is -1.0, and a bad ret for an integer is -1. Thus the following
may be considered bad returns sometimes, but they could also be
perfectly valid.

"" - OR

-1.0 - OR

-1 - Either \<CBNAME\>, \<cbvar\>, or \<cbtot\> is invalid.

AnyValue - The current max of the CB TOT Var for specified CB and CB Var
Group.

Where Used:

sys.get_max() can be called from anywhere as long as there is an active
driver with \<CBNAME\> set appropriately to either CB_DRPROC or
CB_DRSEL.

Example:

The following example gets the current max value for the CB TOT Var
sys.pr_syssize for the current CB Var/EOF Group for the current CB.\
\
max = sys.get_max(sys.pr_syssize);

Description:

sys.get_max() returns the current max val of a CB TOT Var for a CB
Var/EOF Group for a particular CB. It can be called with 1, 2, or 3
arguments.\
\
If called with 1 arg, the arg is \<cbtot\>. sys.get_max() will return
the current max val of the CB TOT Var for the Current CB Var/EOF Group
for the current CB.\
\
If used with 2 args, the args are \<cbvar\> and \<cbtot\>. sys.get_max()
will return the current max val of the CB TOT Var for the specified CB
Var Group for the current CB. You may want to use sys.get_max() in this
manner if you need to access a CB TOT Var of a particular CB Var Group
for the current CB outside of the current CB Var Group.\
\
If used with 3 args, the args are \<CBNAME\>, \<cbvar\>, and \<cbtot\>.
sys.get_max() will return the max val of the CB TOT Var for the
specified CB Var for the specified CB. You may want to use sys.get_max()
in this manner if you need to access a CB TOT Var for a particular CB
Var Group of any CB outside of the processing for that CB.\
\
Thus, you can get any CB TOT Var max val for any CB Var Group for any
currently active CB from any PCL.\
\
In order to get a CB TOT Var max val for the CB EOF Group outside of the
CB EOF Group processing, you need to call sys.get_gmax() instead of
sys.get_max().\
\
4C maintains max values for each CB TOT Var that was defined as MAX for
each CB Var group and for the CB EOF Group. This value is updated at the
same time that totals are updated. That is, the max value is updated
after the rcd has been CB Selected and before running the DRSELECT or
DRPROC PCL. After a CB is processed, the max values of all CB TOT Vars
for each CB Var Group at the same or lower level than the triggering
group are set to NULL. The max values of the CB TOT Vars for all higher
level CB Var Groups and of the CB EOF Group are not modified.
