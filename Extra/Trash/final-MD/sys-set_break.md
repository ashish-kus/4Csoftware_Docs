## sys.set_break()
### Purpose
sys.set_break() sets a 4c session breakpoint.

### Usage
```c
ret = sys.set_break(<prname>,<brktype>,<name>,<asfilename>,<fromval>,<toval>,<flags>);
```

### Arguments
alpha \<prname\> - The name of the program to set the breakpoint in. Use "ALL" to set the breakpoint for all programs.

integer \<brktype\> - One of BRK_PROGRAM, BRK_PCL, BRK_VARIABLE, or BRK_SYSPCL.

alpha \<name\> - A name specific to the type of breakpoint being set. It will be one of pclname, varname, or syspcl name. For BRK_PROGRAM, the \<name\> argument is ignored.

alpha \<asfilename\> - The asfile name for the variable used in a BRK_VARIABLE breakpoint. For all other breakpoint types the \<asfilename\> argument is ignored.

alpha \<fromval\> - The alpha representation of the from value for a BRK_VARIABLE breakpoint when the \<flags\> argument includes BRK_FRVAL. For any other breakpoint type or a BRK_VARIABLE breakpoint with \<flags\> that include BRK_FRANY the \<fromval\> argument is ignored.

alpha \<toval\> - The alpha representation of the to value for a BRK_VARIABLE breakpoint when the \<flags\> argument includes BRK_TOVAL. For any other breakpoint type or a BRK_VARIABLE breakpoint with \<flags\> that include BRK_TOANY the \<toval\> argument is ignored.

integer \<flags\> - Combinations of BRK_ENTRY, BRK_EXIT, BRK_FRANY, BRK_FRVAL, BRK_TOANY, BRK_TOVAL, BRK_LINENO. When setting a BRK_PCL on a specific linenumber of a PCL the flags argument should be set to (BRK_LINENO | lineno).

### Returns
0 - OK. Currently, this is the only value returned.

### Where Used
Normally this is used by the system dbg programs when a developer is doing interactive debugging of a 4c session. However, an application may want to set breakpoints on its own without user control when they use their own program for debugging some exceptional conditions. When used this way, the env var FC_DBGMAIN should be set to the application program that should run when breakpoints are encountered.

### Example
sys.set_break() is useful for applications that need to debug seldom encountered issues that are rarely duplicatable. One scenario for this is to set a breakpoint on the SysPCL `sys.upd_file()` specifying BRK_ENTRY. Then in the application program referenced by FC_DBGMAIN, check for the conditions that you are looking for, such as a value in a file changing to a specific value and if that condition is met, call `sys.app_trace()` to create a complete trace of the current state of the 4c session and then somehow inform the developer via email or text message that the trace was created so someone can look into it. When used this way, the breakpoint is handled by the application program and there should be no end user interaction. The end user will not notice anything different than normal. Unless specifically cleared with `sys.clr_break()`, breakpoints remain in effect across the entire 4c session.

### Description
In order for the application to run its own program when a breakpoint is required, the env var FC_DBGMAIN must be set correctly and the 4C Server version must be 6.4.3 or later.
