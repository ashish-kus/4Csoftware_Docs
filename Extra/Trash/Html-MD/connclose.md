Example:

Description:

sys.conn_close() will close one or more external db and remote file
connections. sys.conn_close() will be mostly used in situations where an
external connection is idle a lot. Rather than letting the firewall
terminate the connection, leaving orphaned processes on the remote
machine, and getting an error the next time the connection is used,
sys.conn_close() will explicitly close the connection. Then the next
time the connection is needed a new one will be opened.
