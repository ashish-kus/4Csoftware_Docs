sys.get_ldata()

### sys.get_ldata()

Purpose:

sys.get_ldata() requests data from an open LData connection.

Usage:

ret = sys.get_ldata(\<ldname\>, \<flags\>);

Arguments:

\<ldname\> - an alpha var that was used in a previous call to
[sys.open_ldata()](./openldata.html)

\<flags\> - can be one of:

- LD_DEFAULT - Using LD_DEFAULT, sys.get_ldata() will not return until
  the data has been retrieved or an error has been returned from the
  external process.
- LD_NOWAIT - Request the data but don't wait for it before returning.
  Using LD_NOWAIT is faster but your application will not know exactly
  when the data has been retrieved.

Returns:

-1 = Failure and sys.errno will be set. Probably no open LData
connection with name \<ldname\>.

0 - Success

Where Used:

sys.get_ldata() can be called from anywhere. If you specified
LD_AUTOMATIC, you won't normally need to call sys.get_ldata() since your
application will be sent the data as it changes anyway.

Example:

Description:

Use sys.get_ldata() to get data from non onetime non automatic LData
connections with external processes. The data will be returned into the
field specified int the sys.open_ldata() call.
