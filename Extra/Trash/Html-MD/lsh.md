lsh()

### lsh()

Purpose:

lsh() runs a command on the local client machine.

Usage:

ret = lsh(\<cmd\>,\[\<options\>\]);

Arguments:

\<cmd\> - The cmd to run, including all arguments. The arguments and the
command name must be separated by spaces.

\<options\> - This is an optional argument that must be either:
LSH_DEFAULT or any combination of the following flags:

- LSH_WAIT - Wait for the lsh process to terminate before continuing.
- LSH_NOWAIT - Do not wait for the lsh process to terminate before
  continuing.
- LSH_CONNECT - Specify this if the client program you are starting will
  be connecting to a new 4c server process on the 4c server machine. If
  security allows a user to connect using the ConnectedUser auth method,
  then the new client program will be able to connect without having to
  specify a user name or passwd.
- LSH_NOEXPAND - Specify this to prevent the client from expanding env
  vars embedded in \<cmd\>.
- LSH_NOCONVERT - Don't convert special characters before running
  command. This is important if it is necessary to leave embedded single
  quotes in the command.

If not specified, LSH_DEFAULT is used. Currently LSH_DEFAULT is the same
as LSH_NOWAIT.

Returns:

0 - Command Submitted to Client

-1 - Error - Communication error with client.

Where Used:

lsh() can be called from anywhere.

Example:

Description:

lsh() runs a local command on the client machine. If LSH_WAIT is
specified as an option, then control will not return to the 4csrvr
process until the local command finishes. Don't use this option when
calling a program that uses DDE. If you do, both w4ccl and the called
program may hang. Otherwise, control returns immediately to the 4csrvr
process.

Requirements

Only clients at version 4.8.0 or higher will expand env vars embedded in
\<cmd\>

The 4c server needs to be at version 4.8.0 or higher in order to use
LSH_NOEXPAND.

Bugs/Features/Comments:

Currently, there is no way to get the exit status of a command run on
the client machine.
