sys.sl_settab()

### sys.sl_settab()

Purpose:

sys.sl_settab() - Dynamically change TabFolders

Usage:

ret =
sys.sl_settab(\<layoutname\>,\<itemname\>,\<sltype\>\[,\<label\>\]);

Arguments:

alpha - \<layoutname\> - The name of the layout that has that TabFolder.
This is the name of the top level layout, not a sublayout. If you
specify "" as the layout name, then the current layout is assumed.

alpha - \<itemname\> - This is the label specified in the specs for this
TabFolder item. Use the same itemname even if you change the label on
the tab.

integer - \<slflags\> - slflags can be any combination of
SL_HIDE,SL_SHOW,SL_DISABLE,SL_ENABLE,SL_SHOW,SL_LABEL

alpha - \<label\> - Optional new label to use for the TabFolder item.

Returns:

0 - OK

-1 - Error.

Where Used:

sys.sl_settab() can be called anytime after a screen layout has been
displayed. Don't call it from the InitPCL of the first program that
starts the layout.

Example:

The sys.prog.mstr bootstrap program dynamically changes the DpyFields
item of the TabFolder in the sys.prog.mstr.sl1 layout. Notice that the
sys.df.maint1 program exits from the the InitPCL if the program is
either an Update or a TreeView program.

Description:

Use sys.sl_settab() to dynamically change the appearance of TabFolder
items in a screen layout. If you specify SL_HIDE, then the tab item will
be invisible until some other call specifies SL_SHOW. If you specify
SL_DISABLE, then the Tab will be grayed out and the user will not be
able to select that tab until another call specifies SL_ENABLE. You can
change the text on the tab by specifying SL_LABEL, \<label\>. The text
should not be any longer than the original label or it may be
truncated.\
\
It is posssible to hide or disable a tab that is currently in use. It is
also possible for the application to start a program that that may be
hidden because the tab is hidden. It is the applications responsibility
to deal with these possibilities.

Bugs/Features/Comments:

There is currently no way to distinguish between items on multiple
TabFolders in the same layout that use the same label.
