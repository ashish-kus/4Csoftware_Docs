sys.build_prog()

### sys.build_prog()

Purpose:

sys.build_prog() compiles a program.

Usage:

ret = sys.build_prog(\<progname\>);

Arguments:

alpha \<progname\> - The name of the program to build.

Returns:

integer \<ret\>

0 - OK

-1 - Error - Probably no such program or compile error, a message has
been displayed.

Where Used:

sys.build_prog() can be called from anywhere. It most likely will be
called from system development programs, and not from other application
programs.

Example:

The system development programs use the \<user15\> key to compile a
program. the statement executed when you press \<user15\> from one of
the development programs is:\
\


    sys.build_prog(sys.pr_name);

Description:

sys.build_prog() compiles the named program. Any errors during
compilation cause an appropriate message to be displayed, and for
sys.build_prog() to return -1.\
\
4C does not compile programs in the sense that machine code is
generated. 4C reads the spec files and converts them into easy to
interpret tables and stores the result in the XLSEQFILE. It does the
same with files. The terms build and compile will be used to both mean
read the 4C specs and write the XLSEQFILE tables.
