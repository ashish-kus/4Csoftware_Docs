## sys.dr_init()
### Purpose
sys.dr_init() initializes the sequential reading of a file.

### Usage
```c
ret = sys.dr_init(<asfile>,<fldnum>,<matchflag> [, <seektype>]);
```

### Arguments
asfile `<asfile>` - The asfile name of the file to read sequentially.

integer `<fldnum>` - The CDefine of the field in `<asfile>` to use as the last non varying part of the key. `<fldnum>` must be a key field in file `<asfile>`.

integer `<matchflag>` - must be MATCH_FULL or MATCH_PARTIAL only. If `<fldnum>` is alpha, then MATCH_PARTIAL means that the only unvarying part of `<fldnum>` is up to its current length. MATCH_FULL means that even trailing spaces are non varying.

integer `<seektype>` - Optional arg that can be either SEEK_START or SEEK_END. The default is SEEK_START. If you specify SEEK_END, then the meaning of F_DRNEXT/F_SEQNEXT and F_DRPREV/F_SEQPREV are reversed.

### Returns
integer `<ret>`

0 - This is the only return

### Where Used
sys.dr_init() can be called anytime that sequential reading of a file is required. This most often will be inside of a DrInit PCL.

### Example
In the display field maintenance program, `sys.df.maint1`, there is a driver for `sys.spc_action`. It is run when deleting fields in order to delete all fkey definitions for that field. The DrInit PCL for `sys.spc_action` is `sadrinit()`. Here is the code:
```c
sys.spca_prname = sys.df_prname ;
sys.spca_varname = sys.df_fieldname ;
sys.dr_init(sys.spc_action,S_SPCAVARNAME,MATCH_FULL);
```
By specifying MATCH_FULL, only rcds that match the current values of `sys.spca_prname` and `sys.spca_varname` will be read. As soon as one of these changes, 4C returns EOF. In the case of a driver, 4C will run the SelEof PCL. The final part of the key `sys.spca_spc` is allowed to vary. Since `S_SPCAVARNAME` references a primary key field, the `sys.spc_action` is read by primary key during the DrSel state.

### Description
sys.dr_init() is used to specify a range of rcds that will be read sequentially. Normally, this is done in a DrInit PCL for a particular driver, but it also will work if you do your own sequential reading using `sys.read_file()`. Before calling `sys.dr_init()`, the values must be set in ALL key fields up to and including the field referenced by `<fldnum>`. Any key fields following `<fldnum>` do not need to be set, and are allowed to vary during the sequential reading. By specifying a `<fldnum>` that references a secondary key, 4C will read the file by that secondary key. The `<matchflag>` is used to specify if the entire field referenced by `<fldnum>` (including trailing spaces) must not vary (MATCH_FULL), or if trailing spaces in the current value are allowed to vary (MATCH_PARTIAL). MATCH_PARTIAL has no meaning for non alpha fields.
