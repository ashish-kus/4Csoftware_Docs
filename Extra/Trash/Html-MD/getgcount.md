sys.get_gcount()

### sys.get_gcount()

Purpose:

Return Grand Record Count\
\
sys.get_gcount() returns the current grand count of CB Selected rcds for
the CB EOF Group for a particular CB.

Usage:


    count = sys.get_gcount();
    count = sys.get_gcount(<CBNAME>);



              Or more generally



    count = sys.get_gcount([<CBNAME>]);

\
\
In most cases, sys.get_gcount() will be used without arguments. When
used this way, it will work with the current CB.\
\
Arguments are allowed so that you can get CB EOF rcd counts without
needing to be processing a particular CB.

Arguments:

\<CBNAME\> - The name of the CB that you need to get the count for. This
is an optional argument. If it is not passed, then sys.get_gcount() uses
the current CB.

Returns:

-1 - \<CBNAME\> is invalid.

\>= 0 - The current grand count of CB Selected rcds for specified CB.

Where Used:

sys.get_count() can be called from anywhere as long as there is an
active driver with \<CBNAME\> set appropriately to either CB_DRPROC or
CB_DRSEL.

Example:

The following example could be used to skip the CB EOF processing if no
records have been CB Selected. Assume that this call is made from the CB
EOF PCL. No arguments are passed, and sys.get_gcount() returns the total
count of records CB Selected for the CB EOF Group of the current CB.\
\
if (sys.get_gcount() == 0) sys.exit_cb();\
\
The next example could be used to skip the printing of totals if only 1
record has been CB Selected. Assume that this call is also made from the
CB EOF PCL. No arguments are passed, and sys.get_gcount() returns the
grand count of records CB Selected for the current CB.\
\
if (sys.get_gcount() \> 1) printtots();

Description:

sys.get_gcount() returns the current grand count of CB Selected rcds for
a particular CB. It can be called with 0 or 1 arguments. The grand rcd
count is the same as the rcd count for the CB EOF Group.\
\
If called with 0 arguments, then the current grand count of CB Selected
rcds for the current CB is returned.\
\
If used with 1 arg, the arg is \<CBNAME\>. sys.get_gcount() will return
the grand count of CB Selected rcds for the current CB. You may want to
use sys.get_gcount() in this manner if you need to access the current
grand rcd count of any CB outside of the processing for that CB.\
\
Thus, you can get any grand rcd count for any currently active CB from
any PCL.\
\
4C maintains the grand rcd count for each CB as the CB EOF Group rcd
count. The grand rcd count is updated at the same time that totals are
updated. That is, the grand rcd count is updated after the rcd has been
CB Selected and before running the DRSELECT or DRPROC PCL. The grand rcd
count is never reset to zero.
