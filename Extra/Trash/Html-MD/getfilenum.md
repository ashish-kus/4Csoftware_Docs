sys.get_filenum()

### sys.get_filenum()

Purpose:

sys.get_filenum() returns the internal file identifier that 4C uses
internally instead of the asfile name.

Usage:

\<filenum\> = sys.get_filenum(\[ \<asprog\>, \] \<filename\>);

Arguments:

alpha \<asprog\> - Optional asprog name of the program to find
\<filename\> in. The default is the current program.

alpha \<filename\>

Returns:

integer \<filenum\>

\>= 0 - The filenum of the file with asfile name \<filename\>.

\< 0 - No asfile with name \<filename\> in current program.

Where Used:

sys.get_filenum() can be called from anywhere. Its main use is probably
in programs used as screen and report writers that do not know which
files they are reading until run time.

Example:

Description:

sys.get_filenum() returns the internal file identifier that 4C uses
internally instead of the asfile name. 4C refers to all files internally
by an integer. This integer can be used in any PCL that expects a file
parameter. Programs that are used as report or screen writers may use
sys.get_filenum() to read a file that is determined only at run time.
