sys.set_exttype()

### sys.set_exttype()

Purpose:

sys.set_exttype() Changes the external type of the \<asfile\> for the
current program.

Usage:

ret = sys.set_exttype(\<asfile\>,\<exttype\> \[, \<extflags\> \]);

Arguments:

asfile \<asfile\> - The asfile name of the file you are setting the
external type of.

alpha \<exttype\> - A valid exttype for the current application

integer \<extflags\> - An optional argument that can be combinations of
EXTTYPE_FILE, EXTTYPE_PROGRAM, and EXTTYPE_ALL. When not specified
EXTTYPE_FILE is the default.

Returns:

None - the type is always set. If the file is not an External type file,
the ext type is ignored when accessing the file. If \<exttype\> is not
valid, you won't find this out until the file is accessed.

Where Used:

sys.set_exttype() can be called from anywhere.

Example:

Description:

Use sys.set_exttype() to change the External type of a 4C file. You may
want to do this if you are copying data from one database to another.
The optional flags mean

- EXTTYPE_FILE - set for singe \<asfile\>. All accesses to that file
  will use the specified external type.
- EXTTYPE_PROGRAM - All explicit SQL statements in the crrent program
  will use the specified external type.
- EXTTYPE_ALL - This will set the XLEXTTYPE env var to the specified
  type so that any explicit SQL statements in any program that do not
  override the external type use the specified external type. Any future
  file opens of external files with ExtType set to XLEXTTYPE will also
  be affected.
