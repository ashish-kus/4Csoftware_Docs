## sys.rset_dfield()
### Purpose
sys.rset_dfield() resets the data field associated with a display field to its original value.

### Usage
```c
ret = sys.rset_dfield(<LABEL>);
```

### Arguments
<LABEL> - the label of the display field that you want to reset.

### Returns
0 - OK

-1 - no display field with label <LABEL>

### Where Used
sys.rset_dfield() can be called from anywhere, but it only makes sense sometime after `sys.set_dfield()` has been called.

### Example
None

### Description
sys.rset_dfield() just resets the display field corresponding to dfldlabel to be associated with the field defined as the display field. It only makes sense to use this PCL if previously you have used the `sys.set_dfield()` PCL.
