sys.get_clrect()

### sys.get_clrect()

Purpose:

sys.get_clrect() returns the dimensions a single client control in
system variables

Usage:

ret = sys.get_clrect(\<controlid\>);

Arguments:

alpha \<controlid\> - The name or type of the client control that you
want to get the dimensions of.

Returns:

integer \<ret\>

0 - OK

-1 - Error

Where Used:

sys.get_clrect() can be called from anywhere as long as there is a
current 4C window currently open on the client. Typically it would be
used in order to determine where you want to display another layout, a
messagebox, or a sys.get_answer() dialog.

Example:

The 4cSys program sys.pr.srch.1 uses sys.get_clrect() in the execdet()
pcl to determine the upper left corner of the current layout and then it
uses that position to set the position for the new program it is
starting.

Description:

sys.get_clrect() returns the dimensions a single client control in
system variables. The dimensions used are the same as those used by the
client. For a win32 client, the dimenions are in pixels, while in a
MacOS X Client, the dimensions are in points. The system variables that
get the dimenasions are sys.rect_left, sys.rect_right, sys.rect_top, and
sys.rect_bottom. Allowable values for \<controlid\> are:

- "Screen" - The dimensions of the full screen where the current 4C
  window is displayed.
- "WorkArea" - The dimensions of the WorkArea where the current 4C
  window is displayed.
- "Layout" - The dimensions of the currently running layout.
- "Prog" or "Program" - The dimensions of the current program.
- "Focus" - The dimensions of the 4C control that currently has the
  focus.
- "DField" - The dimensions of the current 4C display field.
- "Panel" - The dimensions of the panel containing the the 4C control
  that currently has the focus.
- "DrList" - The dimensions of the scrolling list in the current 4C
  program.
- "DrLine" - The dimensions of the current line in the scrolling list of
  the current 4C program
- "TreeView" - The dimensions of TreeView in the current 4C program.
- "TVItem" - The dimensions of the currently selected TVItem
- \<panel\> - The dimensions of the named panel in the current program.
- \<DField\> - The dimensions of the named display field in the current
  program.

Requirements

sys.get_clrect() requires version 5.2 or later for both the 4C server
and the 4C client.
