### sys.dr_epselect1()

Purpose:

sys.dr_epselect1() does end page processing for select scrolling
screens.

Usage:

sys.dr_epselect1();

Arguments:

None

Returns:

None

Where Used:

sys.dr_epselect1() can be called ONLY from the EndPage PCL processing of
a scrolling screen.

Example:

Description:

sys.dr_epselect1() is used for scrolling screens to allow the user to
select 1 rcd. A rcd is selected by pressing the \<accept\> key when the
rcd is highlighted. In addition, if the 4C environment variable,
XLRETURN, is set to "SELECT", then the \<return\> key also selects the
rcd. When a rcd has been selected, the current program exits, setting
\$wexit_code to 0. If the user cancels, then \$wexit_code will be set to
-1.\
\
sys.dr_epselect1() provides a subset of the commands that
sys.dr_epedit() provides. The commands are all 1 key commands and some
of them accept a count also. They are:\
\


         <accept> - Select rcd and exit program.
         <return> - If XLRETURN is "SELECT" then same as accept,
                    otherwise error
         [count]G - GOTO rcd# - If count not specified, then GOTO
                            last rcd.
         <redisplay> - Redisplays screen
         t or T   - Goto 1st rcd
         b or B   - Goto last rcd
