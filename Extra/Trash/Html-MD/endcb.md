sys.end_cb()

### sys.end_cb()

Purpose:

sys.end_cb() exits out of the current CB processing.

Usage:

sys.end_cb();

Arguments:

None

Returns:

0 - Normal

-1 - No current CB

Where Used:

sys.end_cb() can be called from any PCL nested within a CB PCL.

Example:

sys.end_cb();

Description:

sys.end_cb() exits out of the current CB processing. This means that all
PCLs started by the current CB will be exited, and that no new PCLs will
be started by the current CB in the CURRENT CB State. sys.end_cb() can
be used to exit the CBSGROUP, CBEGROUP, CBSELECT, CBBOF, and CBEOF PCLs.
CBBOF/CBSGROUP PCLs and CBEGROUP/CBEOF PCLs act as a group, so when the
CBBOF PCL calls sys.end_cb(), none of the CBSGROUP PCLs will be executed
on the cur rcd. Likewise, on EOF, when one of the CBEGROUP PCLs calls
sys.end_cb(), the CBEOF PCL will not get executed. sys.end_cb() only
acts on the current CB. If there are more than one active CB for a
driver, calling sys.end_cb() only exits the current CB. All others will
still process. There is no difference between sys.end_cb() and
sys.exit_cb().

Bugs/Features/Comments:

sys.end_cb() is no different than sys.exit_cb(). In the future, they may
be different.
