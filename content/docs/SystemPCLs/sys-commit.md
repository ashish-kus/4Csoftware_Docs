## sys.commit()
### Purpose
sys.commit() commits a 4C transaction.

### Usage
```c
ret = sys.commit(<tname>);
```

### Arguments
alpha `<tname>` - A program specific name for the transaction. This name must be the same used that started the transaction.

### Returns
0 - Transaction committed

-1 - Either the transaction specified by `<tname>` does not exist or the transaction was aborted. Check `sys.errno` for ABORT_ERR. Transactions may be aborted due to deadlock situations.

### Where Used
sys.commit() can be called from anywhere, but it can only commit a transaction started within the same 4C program. When possible you should try to use sys.commit() within the same PCL that called `sys.begin()`.

### Example
See `sys.begin()` for example code.

### Description
sys.commit() commits the transaction specified by `<tname>` as well as any nested transactions. Only explicit transactions started by the application can be committed by the application and the transaction must have been started by the same 4C program that calls sys.commit(). You cannot start transaction, "T1", in programA, push ProgramB and commit the transaction, "T1", in programB.

### Bugs / Features / Comments
See the discussion in External Database Files for more details on 4C transactions.
