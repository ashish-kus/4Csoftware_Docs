## sys.build_prlist()
### Purpose
INTERNAL USE ONLY

### Usage
```c
sys.build_prlist(<t_prlist>);
```

### Arguments
file `<t_prlist>` - the asfile name of a file using the sys.t_prlist definition.

### Returns
0 - OK file built  
-1 - The asfile passed was not sys.t_prlist

### Where Used
`sys.build_prlist()` can be called from anywhere. It is meant to be USED INTERNALLY ONLY and currently is used by the 4C debugger programs.

### Example
The following example is from the 4C debugger program `sys.dbg.trace`. It is in the init PCL.
```c
sys.create_tfile(sys.t_prlist);
sys.build_prlist(sys.t_prlist);
```

### Description
`sys.build_prlist()` builds a list of ALL currently running programs into a file using the sys.t_prlist file definition. This file can then be read to see which programs are running for the current user.

### Bugs / Features / Comments
Since this is meant for internal use, the file definition may change when needed.
