sys.push_kprog()

### sys.push_kprog()

Purpose:

sys.push_kprog() is Obsolete. It pushes a 4C program, without having to
reallocate and reinitialize all the usr memory of the program.

Usage:

sys.push_kprog(\<progname\>\[,Arg1-Arg15\]); ret =
sys.push_kprog(\<progname\> \[,arg1 \[,..., \[arg15\] \] ... \]);

Arguments:

progname - alpha

arg1,arg2,...,arg15 0-15 optional alpha args that have meaning to the
called program.

Returns:

\- OK - program ran - exit code now in \$wexit_code

-1 - Err - Could not run program

Where Used:

sys.push_kprog() can be called from anywhere.

Example:

sys.push_kprog("program");

Description:

sys.push_kprog() is the same as sys.push_prog(), except that when this
program exits, all user memory is preserved. The intention is that when
pushing the same program many times from the same program it should be
faster to keep the user memory intact. This should not be used for every
pushed program, only those that may be called many times. For example, a
driver that pushes the same program for every record selected would
benefit a lot from using sys.push_kprog() as opposed to sys.push_prog(),
especially when the number of records is large.\
\
Note: the 'k' in kprog stands for 'keep'.

Bugs/Features/Comments:

If you have trouble when using this, use sys.push_prog(). There could
still be some memory leaks in sys.push_kprog().\
\
This is Obsolete, don't use it anymore.
