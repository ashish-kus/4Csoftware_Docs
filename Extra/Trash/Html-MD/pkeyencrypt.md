sys.pkey_encrypt()

### sys.pkey_encrypt()

Purpose:

sys.pkey_encrypt() encrypts and encodes a small chunk of text using
either a public or private key

Usage:

b64text = sys.pkey_encrypt(\<pkeyname\>,\<text\>,\<encodingtype\>);

Arguments:

alpha - \<pkeyname\> - The name used by the application when opening the
public or private key.

alpha - \<text\> - The clear text to encrypt.

integer - \<encodingtype\> - must be ENCODE_BASE64 or ENCODE_BASE64URL

Returns:

\<b64text\> - The base64 encoding of the encrypted text.

"" - Some error

Where Used:

sys.pkey_encrypt() can be called from anywhere as long as you have a
valid public or private RSA key open open.

Example:

The demo program demo.pkey.1 has an example of using a public/private
key to encrypt and then using only the private key to decrypt a small
amount of text. If you try to do this with too large a piece of text you
will see that it fails at a fairly small length.

Description:

sys.pkey_encrypt() will use an open public or private key to encrypt and
encode a very small amount of text. This should really only be used when
it is necessary to encrypt a symetric key and send it securely to
another system. The size of text that can be encrypted is fairly small
and you should assume it is no larger than 86 bytes.

Requirements

4csrvr version 5.2.8 or later
