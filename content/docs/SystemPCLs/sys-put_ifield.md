## sys.put_ifield()
### Purpose
sys.put_ifield() stores an integer value in an integer field by name.

### Usage
ret = sys.put_ifield([<asprog>], <asfilename>, <fieldname>, <ival>);

### Arguments
asprog <asprog> - The asprog name of the program to use to find <asfilename> and <fieldname>. This is an optional argument, and if not used, the current program is assumed.

alpha <asfilename> - The asfile name of the file containing <fieldname>. This must be passed in quotes, or in an alpha variable.

alpha <fieldname> - The name of the field you want to store the value. This must be passed in quotes, or in an alpha variable. Dimesioned variables can be used also using a format like "field[n]"

integer <ival> - The integer value to store in <fieldname>.

### Returns
0 - OK - <ival> stored in <fieldname>

-1 - Error - Either <asprog> or <asfilename> or <fieldname> is invalid.

### Where Used
sys.put_ifield() can be called from anywhere. It may be used in report/screen writers that do not know what fields they are using until runtime.

### Example
None

### Description
sys.put_ifield() locates the field identified by <fieldname> and stores <ival> in it. sys.put_ifield() is meant to be used when you don't know the field to store into until runtime.

### Bugs / Features / Comments
If <fieldname> is not an integer type, no error is indicated, but no value is stored either.
