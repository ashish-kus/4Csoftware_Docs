sys.skip()

### sys.skip()

Purpose:

sys.skip() skips nlines for the current program and updates the current
line number counter for the current device.

Usage:

retcode = sys.skip(nlines);\
\
or\
\
sys.skip(nlines);

Arguments:

integer nlines;\
\
nlines is the number of lines that you want to skip.

Returns:

0 Normal return

-1 Error - nskips \<= 0 - And NO action is taken.\
\
For this PCL, the return code is not really very useful, but it is
there.

Where Used:

sys.skip() is usually used with Control Break PCLS.

Example:

if (sys.get_linediff()) sys.skip(sys.get_linediff() + 1);

Description:

sys.skip() is used mainly by scrolling programs to skip over nested
programs. It can, however, be used by programs that do not print
anything. If used this way, programs that are called by the non-printing
program probably use sys.get_linenum() to set \$row_ofst or
sys.page_ofst.\
\
If nlines is great enough to pass the physical end of page for the
current device, then it acts EXACTLY like a call to sys.page().
Likewise, if it is great enough to pass the logical end of page for a
scrolling program then it will also act EXACTLY like sys.page(). In
these cases ALL cautions that pertain to sys.page() also pertain to
sys.skip().\
\
When used by programs that do not print, all sys.skip() does is update
the current line number for the current device. The current linenumber
is updated based on the position of the last printed item by any program
using that device, not necessarily the highest line number used by that
device.\
\
When sys.page() is called from a program that does print, then the
current linenumber is updated based on the last item to print for the
current program.\
\
When called from a scrolling program, after updating the current line
number for the current device, 4C updates the remaining lines of the
current page with their new positions. Only lines that have not yet
printed are updated. This may change the number of records that 4C can
actually print on a logical page for the scrolling program. Of course,
if it changes it, it will change it to a smaller number.

Bugs/Features/Comments:

If used in scrolling screens, sys.skip() is unpredictable. If used in
the Program DrProc PCL and this causes a Page Break, then the DrProc PCL
will execute again with the same rcd.
