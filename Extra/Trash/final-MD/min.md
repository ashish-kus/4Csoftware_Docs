## min()
### Purpose
min() returns the minimum float/integer of its arguments.

### Usage
```c
minval = min(<arg1> [,<arg2> [, ..., [<arg16>]] ... ]);
```

### Arguments
float `<arg1>`-`<arg16>` - The numerics to compare and get the min of.  
You can pass integers instead of floats because 4C will do the numeric conversions.

### Returns
float `<minval>` - The minimum of all passed args.  
4C returns a float, but you can assign this to an integer instead since 4C will convert it.

### Where Used
min() can be called from anywhere.

### Example
None

### Description
min() returns the minimum float/integer of its arguments. min() can be used with integers, dates, times, and floats.  
Arguments can be passed as integers/dates/times instead of floats because 4C will do the numeric conversions.  
This type conversion works on returns also.

### Bugs / Features / Comments
Prior to 4C Server version 4.4.7 min() is not reliable. Do not use min() unless your server is version 4.4.7 or higher.  
Prior to 4C Server version 4.4.7, min() only works with float args. You will get a compile error if you try to use it with other types of args.
