sys.show_panel()

### sys.show_panel()

Purpose:

sys.show_panel() is used to show, hide, enable, or disable a panel.

Usage:

ret = sys.show_panel(\<pnlcdef\>,\<showflags\>);

Arguments:

integer \<pnlcdef\> - the cdef of the panel.

integer \<showflags\> - Combinations of SF_SHOW, SF_HIDE, SF_ENABLE,
SF_DISABLE, SF_IGNORE, SF_NOIGNORE, SF_NOSHOWPARENT

Returns:

integer \<ret\>

0 - OK

-1 - Not a screen program, invalid pnlcdef, or client version not up to
date.

Where Used:

sys.show_panel() can be called from any PCL in a Panel program except
the InitPCL, EndPCL, and ExitPCL.

Example:

See the demo.hrc.2, demo.ovly.2, demo.ovly.3, and demo.tabf.3 demo
programs for examples. An example of using sys.show_panel() with the
SF_NOSHOWPARENT flag is in the bootstrap program sys.df.fm.pnl.

Description:

sys.show_panel() is used to show, hide, enable, or disable a panel. The
way sys.show_panel() works depends on which showflags are specifed.\
\

- SF_SHOW - Make the specified panel visible. Unless SF_NOSHOWPARENT is
  specified, then all containing panels will be made visible as well.
  Any child panel or display field that was implicitly hidden due to the
  specified panel being hidden will also be made visible. Any subpanel
  or dfield that was explicitly hidden will not be made visible.
- SF_HIDE - Hide the specified panel. Any subpanels of the panel as well
  as all contained dfields will be implicitly hidden. Hiding a child of
  a TabFolder will remove the corresponding label from the TabFolder.
  The label will be added back to the TabFolder when the child panel is
  unhidden programmatically.
- SF_ENABLE - Enable the specified panel as well as all containing
  panels. Any child panel or display field that was implicitly disabled
  due to the specified panel being disabled will also be enabled. Any
  subpanel or dfield that was explicitly disabled will not be enabled.
- SF_DISABLE - Disable the panel. Any subpanels of the panel as well as
  all contained dfields will be implicitly disabled. Disabling a child
  of a TabFolder will disable the label for that panel and you will not
  be able to raise that panel until it has been enabled.
- SF_IGNORE - When specified with either SF_DISABLE or SF_HIDE, all
  contained dfields will be ignored during the display field processing
  loop. Since this is the default behaviour for both SF_DISABLE and
  SF_HIDE, it is not necessary to specify SF_IGNORE.
- SF_NOIGNORE - When specified with either SF_DISABLE or SF_HIDE,
  contained dfields will be processed normally during the display field
  processing loop.
- SF_NOSHOWPARENT - Don't immediately show containing panels. This is
  useful when the Panel is embedded within a Panel tabfolder and you do
  not want to immediately show the tab.

\
\
In the case of tabfolder or overlay sub panels, making one sub panel
visible will result in making any sibling sub panels invisible.\
\
Hiding a panel will not automatically make any other panels visible.
