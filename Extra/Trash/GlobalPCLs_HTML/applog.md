version 6.2.7. The application log is automatically purged as needed and
you can configure the frequency of the purging through the System
COnfiguration for the application. You can view entries in the the
application by running the \"Application Log\" entry under \"Logging\"
in the main sys.menu.tv developers menu.\
\
Most entries in the application log are made by the application programs
mostly for the purpose of logging events that can be reviewed later.
However, there are some exceptional conditions that are automatically
logged by the system.

Requirements

4cserver version 6.2.7 or later
