## sys.build_stlist()
### Purpose
INTERNAL USE ONLY

### Usage
```c
sys.build_stlist(<t_stlist>, <asprog>);
```

### Arguments
file `<t_stlist>` - the asfile name of a file using the `sys.t_stlist` definition.

asprog `<asprog>` - The name the program was called by when it was started.

### Returns
0 - OK file built  
-1 - The asfile passed was not `sys.t_stlist` or `<asprog>` is not currently active.

### Where Used
`sys.build_stlist()` can be called from anywhere. It is meant to be USED INTERNALLY ONLY and currently is used by the 4C debugger programs.

### Example
The following example is from the 4C debugger program `sys.dbg.trace.st`. It is in the init PCL.
```c
sys.create_tfile(sys.t_stlist);
sys.build_stlist(sys.t_stlist, sys.tp_asprog);
```

### Description
`sys.build_stlist()` builds a list of the internal 4C state stack for ONE program into a file using the `sys.t_stlist` file definition. This file can then be read to display the state stack.

### Bugs / Features / Comments
If more than one program is active with the same asprog name, only the most recently active one is used by `sys.build_stlist()`.  
Since this is meant for internal use, the file definition may change when needed.
