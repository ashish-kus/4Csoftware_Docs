## sys.get_fmtfield()
### Purpose
None
### Usage
```c
ret = sys.get_fmtfield([<asprog>], <asfilename>, <fieldname>, <retbuf>);
```
### Arguments
- asprog `<asprog>` - The asprog name of the program to use to find `<asfilename>` and `<fieldname>`. This is an optional argument, and if not used, the current program is assumed.
- alpha `<asfilename>` - The asfile name of the file containing `<fieldname>`.
- alpha `<fieldname>` - The name of the field you want to format. This must be passed in quotes, or in an alpha variable. Dimesioned variables can be used also using a format like "field[n]".
- alpha `<retbuf>` - The alpha field where 4C will store the formatted field. This field is passed by name and should not be quoted.
### Returns
- 0 - OK - the formatted value of `<fieldname>` is in `<retbuf>`.
- -1 - Error - Either `<asprog>` or `<asfilename>` or `<fieldname>` is invalid.
### Where Used
sys.get_fmtfield() can be called from anywhere. It is useful in programs that are report/screen writers and you don't know what is to be displayed until runtime.
### Example
There are several examples in the 4C debugger program sys.dbg.fld.det.
### Description
sys.get_fmtfield() formats a field and stores the formatted field in the `<retbuf>` arg.
### Bugs / Features / Comments
Only the format that is defined for `<fieldname>` in the data dictionary is used. You cannot specify another format.
