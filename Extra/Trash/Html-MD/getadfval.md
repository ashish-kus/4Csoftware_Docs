sys.get_adfval()

### sys.get_adfval()

Purpose:

sys.get_adfval() returns the alpha value of a display field.

Usage:

aval = sys.get_adfval(\<DFLABEL\>);

Arguments:

\<DFLABEL\> - The label for the field. This is an integer from 0 to num
display fields - 1. sys.cur_field may be used.

Returns:

The alpha value of the display field.

Blank - possible error

Where Used:

sys.get_adfval() can be called from anywhere but will probably be called
from a verify pcl for a display field.

Example:

Description:

sys.get_adfval() returns the unformatted alpha value of a display field.
You may want to use this in the verify PCL for a display field if you
need to do some type of special formatting. You can use this in a global
PCL and not need to know the name of a display field in order to get its
value. Just pass sys.cur_field as the \<DFLABEL\>.

Bugs/Features/Comments:

It is impossible to tell if a blank return means an error or if the
value of the field really is blank. However, the only errors are DFLABEL
out of range, or the data type of the display field is not an alpha.
