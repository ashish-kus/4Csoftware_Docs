## sys.set_extfname()
### Purpose
sys.set_extfname() allows you to set the external file name of a file.

### Usage
```c
sys.set_extfname(<asfile>,<extfname>);
```

### Arguments
asfile \<asfile\> - The asfile name of the file to set the extname of.

alpha \<extfname\> - The new external name to use.

### Returns
None

### Where Used
sys.set_extfname() can be called from anywhere. However, it will probably be called before any rcd accesses are made.

### Example
None

### Description
sys.set_extfname() allows you to set the external name of a file. The external name can be any name valid in the fiel definition. This includes directory names, environment variables, and absolute path names. sys.set_extfname() closes the file if it is open to this program. The next rcd access will cause the file to be opened using the the new name. If there is a problem with the new name, it will show up when the file is re-opened. All other programs using the same file will continue with the same external name they were using before. The only programs that are affected by the new name besides the current program are programs that are started AFTER the sys.set_extfname() call AND share the file FULL.

### Bugs / Features / Comments
No checking to see if name is valid is done
