## sys.kill_prog()
### Purpose
sys.kill_prog() kills the program specified by the <asprog> argument.

### Usage
```c
ret = sys.kill_prog(<asprog>,[exitcode], [killflags]);
```

### Arguments
asprog <asprog> - The asprog name of the program that is to be killed.

integer [exitcode] - optional arg to set the exit code of the program killed. If you do not set this, then the value EXIT_KILL is the exit code of your program. Normally, if you set this arg, you will use EXIT_KILL for the exit code.

integer [killflags] - Optional arg to specify how kill should work. These flags can be or'd together. If you specify killflags, then the optional arg [exitcode] needs to be specified also. You can use any of the following for [killflags].

1.  K_SINGLE - Kill only the program specified. This is the default if no killflags are specified.
2.  K_CHILDREN - Kill all children of program specified. This flag alone will not kill the program specified, only programs that are children of it.
3.  K_LEVEL - Kill all programs on same level or lower than program specified.
4.  K_DEFAULT - Shorthand for K_SINGLE|K_CHILDREN. This is NOT the default if no flags are specified.

### Returns
0 - OK - program killed

-1 - No such program <asprog>.

### Where Used
sys.kill_prog() can be called from anywhere. Currently it is used by the 4C debugger.

### Example
The 4C debugger program sys.dbg.kill allows you to kill a running program from the debugger. The following code comes from the killit PCL of this program.

```c
if (killflag == 'y') {
    beep();
    return;
}
sys.kill_prog(sys.tp_asprog);
killflag = 'y'
```

### Description
sys.kill_prog() kills a 4C program. It can only be used for the current 4C session. You cannot kill a program of another 4C process. Killing a program causes the killed program to set run the PrEnd PCL when it regains control. One effect of killing a program is that when control returns to it, it will not redraw itself.

### Bugs / Features / Comments
When a program is killed, the End PCL and the Exit PCL will both be executed. This may need to be changed.
