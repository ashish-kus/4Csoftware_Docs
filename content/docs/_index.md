## Why this Documentation

Every technology deserves clear and well-structured documentation. The original 4C manuals contain valuable information, but they can feel scattered, outdated, and difficult to navigate. This guide is an attempt to organize everything into one clean, streamlined knowledge base for the 4C Software Platform.

The goal is simple: make learning and working with 4C easier. Instead of jumping between old manuals and loosely connected sections, this documentation focuses on better structure, clearer explanations, and easier search and navigation — so you can quickly find what you need and understand how things fit together.## Explore
