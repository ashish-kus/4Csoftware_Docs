sys.set_help()

### sys.set_help()

Purpose:

sys.set_help() allows you to modify the 4C environment variable
XLHELPMSG.

Usage:

ret = sys.set_help(\<helpmsg\>);

Arguments:

alpha \<helpmsg\> - This can be "ON" or "OFF" only. Any other value is
ignored and causes an error return.

Returns:

integer \<ret\>

0 - OK - XLHELPMSG set.

-1 - \<helpmsg\> Illegal Val.

Where Used:

sys.set_help() can be called from anywhere. It is most likely used in
system programs that allow the user to change their environment.

Example:

In the system program sys.help.set, the EndFld PCL for ok calls
sethelp() which in turn calls sys.set_help() to set the user specified
value for XLHELPMSG. The entire sethelp() PCL follows:\
\


    sys.set_help(helpmsg);
    sys.set_fkhelp(fkhelp);
    sys.set_msgline1(msgl1);
    sys.set_msgline2(msgl2);
    sys.set_return(retsel);

Description:

sys.set_help() sets the value of the 4C environment variable XLHELPMSG.
This env variable is used to control whether help messages display
automatically. If XLHELPMSG is set to "ON", then 4C will display field
help messages on XLMSGLINE1. If set to "OFF", then 4C does not display
any field help messages automatically.

Bugs/Features/Comments:

The values stored in the 4C Environment variables may be different than
those at the shell. Calls to sys.set_help() etc do not modify the
shell's environment, only 4C's internal copy. Even shells started from
4C will not share the same environment if the 4C environment has changed
during running.\
\
Of Course this is subject to change.
