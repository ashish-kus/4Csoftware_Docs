## sys.get_ffield()
### Purpose
`sys.get_ffield()` returns a float value from a float field by name.

### Usage
```c
fval = sys.get_ffield([<asprog>], <asfilename>, <fieldname>);
```

### Arguments
- `asprog <asprog>` - The asprog name of the program to use to find `<asfilename>` and `<fieldname>`. This is an optional argument, and if not used, the current program is assumed.
- `alpha <asfilename>` - The asfile name of the file containing `<fieldname>`. This must be passed in quotes, or in an alpha variable.
- `alpha <fieldname>` - The name of the field who's value you want. This must be passed in quotes, or in an alpha variable. Dimesioned variables can be used also using a format like "field[n]".

### Returns
- `float <fval>` - The value in field `<fieldname>`
- `-1.0` - Possible error, but could also mean that `<fieldname>` has the value -1.0.

### Where Used
`sys.get_ffield()` can be called from anywhere. It may be used in report/screen writers that do not know what fields they are using until runtime.

### Example
None

### Description
`sys.get_ffield()` locates the field identified by `<fieldname>` and returns the value in it. `sys.get_ffield()` is meant to be used when you don't know the field to get until runtime.

### Bugs / Features / Comments
If `<fieldname>` is not a float type, no error is indicated, and -1.0 will be returned.
