sys.set_mod()

### sys.set_mod()

Purpose:

sys.set_mod() sets or toggles "Modify" mode.

Usage:

sys.set_mod();

Arguments:

None

Returns:

None

Where Used:

sys.set_mod() should only be called during field processing of input
screens. sys.set_mod() is most often called from the \<modify\> key PCL
processing.

Example:

In the development program sys.prog.mstr, sys.set_mod() is called if the
\<modify\> key is pressed on the sys.pr_name field.

Description:

sys.set_mod() is called when you want the default rcd access mode to be
"Modify". When called, 4C first checks to see if the XLMODETOGGLE var is
set to ON. If it is and sys.mode is already "Modify", 4C sets it back to
"Lookup". If it is anything else, then 4C sets sys.mode to "Modify".
Next, 4C checks to see if it is in a field processing state. If so, then
the next field state is set to exit that field. This will only happen
after all nested PCLs are exited normally. The next field to process
will be sys.cur_field if no input was entered on that field. If input
was entered, then the next field to process will be sys.cur_field + 1.\
\
sys.mode can be reset to "Lookup" by pressing the \<cancel\> key, or if
XLMODETOGGLE is "ON", by calling sys.set_mod() again.\
\
The main effect of calling sys.set_mod() is that the system variable
sys.mode in '\$syslocalf' is set to "Modify". This affects calls to
sys.read_file() with the F_DEFAULT flag. Since sys.mode is in the local
system file, this only affects the current program.\
\
Currently, there are no other side effects of calling sys.set_mod() but
I would advise not to call it except during field processing.

Bugs/Features/Comments:

There is no corresponding sys.set_look() PCL.
