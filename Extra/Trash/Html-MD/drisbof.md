### sys.dr_isbof()

Purpose:

sys.dr_isbof() indicates wether the current driver is at the beginning
of file or not.

Usage:

if (sys.dr_isbof()) dosomething();

Arguments:

Where Used:

sys.dr_isbof() can be called from anywhere as long as there is a current
driver.

Example:

if (sys.dr_isbof()) setdefaults();

Description:

sys.dr_isbof() is called to determine if the current driver is at the
beginning of file or not. If the driver is currently processing the
first selected record then it returns 1. Otherwise it returns 0. If
there is no current driver, sys.dr_isbof() will return -1.\
\
In the SPagePCL, if the next line to display is the first line, then
sys.dr_isbof() will return 1. Otherwise sys.dr_isbof() will return 0.\
\
In the DrProcPCL, the SFldlpPCL, any field PCL, and the EFldlpPCL, if
the current record being processed is the first record, then
sys.dr_isbof() will return 1. Otherwise sys.dr_isbof() will return 0.\
\
The EPagePCL cannot be used to call sys.dr_isbof().\
\
sys.dr_isbof() can be used instead of checking if dr_sequence is equal
to 1.
