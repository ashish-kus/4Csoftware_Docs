sys.link_group()

### sys.link_group()

Purpose:

sys.link_group() starts a new 4C group or links to an existing one.

Usage:

ret = sys.link_group(\<flags\>,\<gpname\>,\<progname\>);

Arguments:

int flags - Currently unused

alpha \<grpname\> - Any alpha value is a valid group name.

alpha \<progname\> - The real program name of the program to start if
\<grpname\> does not exist yet.

Returns:

integer \<ret\>

0 - OK - link succeeded

-1 - Could not run program \<progname\>

Where Used:

sys.link_group() can be called from anywhere. It will eventually be
integrated into 4C better than it is now.

Example:

The following example is from the program sys.grp.start. It is the
EndFldLoop PCL.\
\


    sys.link_group(0,grpname,progname);
    sys.exit_prog(0);

Description:

sys.link_group() starts a new 4C group or links to an existing one. A 4C
group is a set of programs, pushed and linked, working together as a
group. 4C allows you to run multiple independant groups. Each group
maintains its own context and the user can switch between groups with
function keys. The programmer can also switch between groups using
sys.link_group(). The group name can be any alpha value. The group name
uniquely identifies a group.

Bugs/Features/Comments:

This group stuff is only experimental right now and it will be better
defined in the future.
