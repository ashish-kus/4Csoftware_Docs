## sys.get_idfval()
### Purpose
sys.get_idfval() returns the integer value of a display field.

### Usage
```c
ival = sys.get_idfval(<DFLABEL>);
```

### Arguments
<DFLABEL> - The label for the field. This is an integer from 0 to num display fields - 1. `sys.cur_field` may be used.

### Returns
The integer value of the display field.

-1 - possible error

### Where Used
sys.get_idfval() can be called from anywhere but will probably be called from a verify pcl for a display field.

### Example
None

### Description
sys.get_idfval() returns the integer value of a display field. You may want to use this in the verify PCL for a display field if you need to do some type of special formatting. You can use this in a global PCL and not need to know the name of a display field in order to get its value. Just pass `sys.cur_field` as the <DFLABEL>.

### Bugs / Features / Comments
It is impossible to tell if a -1 return means an error or if the value of the field really is -1. However, the only errors are DFLABEL out of range, or the data type of the display field is not an integer.
