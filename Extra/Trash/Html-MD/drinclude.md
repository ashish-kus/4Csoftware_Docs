sys.dr_include()

### sys.dr_include()

Purpose:

sys.dr_include() allows you to include fields other than primary key
fields and sort key fields in the 4C driver file.

Usage:

ret = sys.dr_include(\<asfile\>,\<fldcdef\>,\[\<flag\>\]);

Arguments:

asfile \<asfile\> - The asfile name of the file containing the field to
include.

integer \<fldcdef\> - The CDEFINE of the field to include.

integer \<flag\> - This is an optional argument and currently can have
the values DR_NOCLR or DR_CLR only. If not specified, then fields from
the driver file are not cleared before the DrSelect PCL, but other
fields are.

Returns:

integer \<ret\>

0 - OK

-1 - No current driver, or current driver not in DRINIT state.

Where Used:

sys.dr_include() can be called ONLY from the DrInit PCL. It always
applies to the current driver. It makes no difference where during the
DrInit PCL that sys.dr_include() is called.

Example:

In the program sys.prmem.rpt2.2, three data fields are included in the
4C driver file. This means that the file sys.file_hdr will not need to
be read during the DrProc PCL or during field processing in order to
access those fields. The relevant code from drinit() follows:\
\


    sys.dr_include(sys.file_hdr,S_FHSYSSIZE);
    sys.dr_include(sys.file_hdr,S_FHUSRSIZE);
    sys.dr_include(sys.file_hdr,S_FHSEQSIZE);

Description:

The purpose of sys.dr_include() is to allow values that need a lot of
time to calculate to be calculated only once. This is necessary on
scrolling screens that may redisplay the same rcd multiple times. If the
computed val won't change during the scrolling screens life, and it
requires a lot of time to calculate, then sys.dr_include() may speed up
that particular scrolling screen.\
\
sys.dr_include() can also save processing time in reports by avoiding
file rereads. When values are needed both in the DrSort PCL and the
DrProc PCL using sys.dr_include() will make the extra file read in the
DrProc PCL unnecessary.\
\
There is never any point to calling sys.dr_include() for fields in the
main driver file itself since 4C always reads this file before the
DrProc PCL.\
\
Fields that are dr included, but are not fields from the driver file
will be cleared as a default before the DrSelect PCL is run. This action
can be overriden by specifying DR_NOCLR in the sys.dr_include() call.
Fields that are dr included, and are fields in the driver file will not
be cleared before the DrSelect PCL is run unless DR_CLR was specified in
the sys.dr_include() call.
