sys.get_parent()

### sys.get_parent()

Purpose:

sys.get_parent() returns the asprog name of the parent of the current
program or of the program specified in the \<asprog\> argument.

Usage:

parent = sys.get_parent(\[\<asprog\>\]);

Arguments:

asprog \<asprog\> - The asprog name of the program you want the name of
the parent of.\
\
This is an optional argument, and if it is not used, then the current
program is assumed.

Returns:

"" - Either no such asprog \<asprog\>, or \<asprog\> is at the top of
the 4C hierarchy and has no parent.

parent - The asprog name of the parent of \<asprog\>

Where Used:

sys.get_parent() can be called from anywhere.

Example:

Description:

sys.get_parent() returns the asprog name of the parent of the current
program or of the program specified in the \<asprog\> argument. The
parent may or may not be the program that started \<asprog\>. If
\<asprog\> was pushed, then it will be the calling program. If
\<asprog\> was linked, then it will be the program that pushed the first
program on the same level as \<asprog\>. If \<asprog\> was execed, then
its parent is the parent of the program that execed it.

Bugs/Features/Comments:

If more than one program exist with the same \<asprog\> name,
sys.get_parent() only ever sees one of them. It will be the most
recently used.\
\
There is no way to determine the name of the program that called a
program, except for a pushed program where the parent program is the
calling program.
