sys.message()

### sys.message()

Purpose:

sys.message() displays either an error or an info message.

Usage:

ret = sys.message(\<smflags\>,arg1\[,arg2,...arg15);

Arguments:

\<smflags\> - Integer flags that can be or'd together. Possible values
are:

- SM_DEFAULT - Assumes SM_ERROR\|SM_WAIT\|SM_BEEP
- SM_INFO - Displays info message.
- SM_ERROR - Displays error message.
- SM_WAIT - Waits for user to click ok or press return before
  continueing.
- SM_NOWAIT - Displays message at bottom of layout and does not wait for
  user input.
- SM_TITLE - Uses first arg as title to the message dialog. If the first
  arg is not an alpha, then the SM_TITLE is ignored.
- SM_NOTITLE - Uses default title.
- SM_FLUSH - Flushes output to client so client even sees SM_NOWAIT
  messages immediately.
- SM_NOFLUSH - Does not flush SM_NOWAIT messages immediately. This flag
  has no effect on SM_WAIT messages.
- SM_BEEP - Sounds the bell with the message.
- SM_NOBEEP - Does not sound the bell.
- SM_LOG - Writes the message to the ErrLogFile file specified in
  XLCONFIG.
- SM_FMT - Format alpha fields using the associated format. Non alpha
  fields are always formatted using the flds format. The reason alpha
  fields are not is because when only alpha fields were allowed, they
  were not formatted. Just don't want to surprise anybody.
- SM_SEP - Uses first non title arg as a separator. If it is not an
  alpha, then SM_SEP is ignored.
- SM_DELIM - Uses first non title arg as delimiter. If it is not an
  alpha, then SM_DELIM is ignored. The difference between SM_DELIM and
  SM_SEP is that SM_DELIM displays before first arg and after last arg
  as well as between all args. SM_SEP only displays between the args.

AnyType - \<arg\[1-15\]\> - Multiple flds that are formated and
concatenated to form the message. The difference between SM_DELIM and
SM_SEP is that SM_DELIM displays before first arg and after last arg as
well as between all args. SM_NOSEP - Specifies not to display a
separator char between args. If none of SM_DELIM\|SM_SEP\|SM_NOSEP are
specified, a space character displays between args. SF

Returns:

0 - Currently the only value that can be returned.

Where Used:

sys.message() can be called from anywhere.

Example:

sys.message(SM_INFO\|SM_TITLE,"4CSys Info","No Such Program");

Description:

sys.message() displays either an error or an info message. This is meant
to replace both sys.msg() and sys.err_msg(). If you do not specify a
title as part of the sys.message() statement, then 4c will use the
application ErrorWinTitle or the application InfoWinTitle if specified
in the \_4CSRVRCONFIG file. If no title is specified then 4C will use
the name of the application followed by either " - Info" or " - Error"
for the window title.\

Requirements

4CServer version 5.0.6-05 or higher is required for using non alpha
arguments

4CServer version 5.0.6-05 or higher is required for specifying SM_LOG,
SM_FMT, SM_SEP, SM_NOSEP, and SM_DELIM flags.

Bugs/Features/Comments:

If none of SM_ERROR, SM_INFO, or SM_LOG are specified, then SM_ERROR is
assumed.

If SM_LOG is specified and neither SM_ERROR nor SM_INFO are, then
amessage is written to the ErrLogFile, but nothing is displayed to the
user.
