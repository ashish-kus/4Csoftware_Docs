You can nest transactions if you like. For each transaction started, you should call either sys.commit() or sys.rollback(). If you neglect to commit a transaction that you started with sys.begin(), 4C will eventually commit the transaction if the program exits with a 0 exit code, or 4C will rollback the transaction if the program exits with a negative exit code. The transaction will also be rolled back if 4C reaches a state earlier in the program than when the transaction was started. This is possible if the EFldPCL of an input field starts a transaction and the user cancels before the application calls sys.commit(). The T_AUTOCOMMIT, T_APPCOMMIT, and T_4CCOMMIT flags are used to override the default commit type of the transaction. The T_READUNCOMMITTED, T_READCOMMITTED, T_REPEATABLEREAD, and T_SERIALIZABLE flags are used to override the default isolation level of the transaction. The T_RCDLOCKS and T_NORCDLOCKS are used to override the default way 4C will lock records in the transaction. T_RCDLOCKS means that 4C will obtain an update lock when a record is read in an update mode. T_NORCDLOCKS means that 4C will acquire a share lock only. When the file is updated, the share lock will be upgraded to an update lock.\nBugs / Features / Comments See the discussion in External Database Files for more details on 4C transactions. New flags will soon be available to specify whether 4C locking should be used in the transaction and at what isolation level the transaction will execute.

This is necessary on scrolling screens that may redisplay the same rcd multiple times. If the computed val won\u0026rsquo;t change during the scrolling screens life, and it requires a lot of time to calculate, then sys.dr_include() may speed up that particular scrolling screen.\nsys.dr_include() can also save processing time in reports by avoiding file rereads. When values are needed both in the DrSort PCL and the DrProc PCL using sys.dr_include() will make the extra file read in the DrProc PCL unnecessary.\nThere is never any point to calling sys.dr_include() for fields in the main driver file itself since 4C always reads this file before the DrProc PCL.\nFields that are dr included, but are not fields from the driver file will be cleared as a default before the DrSelect PCL is run.

As soon as one of these changes, 4C returns EOF. In the case of a driver, 4C will run the SelEof PCL. The final part of the key sys.spca_spc is allowed to vary. Since S_SPCAVARNAME references a primary key field, the sys.spc_action is read by primary key during the DrSel state.\nDescription sys.dr_init() is used to specify a range of rcds that will be read sequentially. Normally, this is done in a DrInit PCL for a particular driver, but it also will work if you do your own sequential reading using sys.read_file(). Before calling sys.dr_init(), the values must be set in ALL key fields up to and including the field referenced by \u0026lt;fldnum\u0026gt;. Any key fields following \u0026lt;fldnum\u0026gt; do not need to be set, and are allowed to vary during the sequential reading. By specifying a \u0026lt;fldnum\u0026gt; that references a secondary key, 4C will read the file by that secondary key. The \u0026lt;matchflag\u0026gt; is used to specify if the entire field referenced by \u0026lt;fldnum\u0026gt; (including trailing spaces) must not vary (MATCH_FULL), or if trailing spaces in the current value are allowed to vary (MATCH_PARTIAL).

Where Used sys.get_keyno() can be called from anywhere. It will normally be called so that the keyno can be passed to other system PCLs that expect it. In particular, a DrInit PCL that calls sys.seek_key() should call sys.get_keyno() instead of hardcoding the \u0026lt;keyno\u0026gt; argument.\nExample In the system program, sys.prmem.rpt1.1, the DrInit PCL for sys.program sets the start and end key and then calls sys.seek_key(). sys.seek_key() expects a keynum argument, which is gotten by calling sys.get_keyno. Coding it this way allows for the keynum to change if you modify the file definition.

When used this way, it will work with the current CB and the current CB Var/EOF Group. Optional arguments are allowed so that you can get running totals without needing to be processing a particular CB Var Group or even a particular CB.\nArguments \u0026lt;CBNAME\u0026gt; - The name of the CB that you need to get a running total for. This is an optional argument. If it is not passed, then sys.get_tot() uses the current CB. If it is passed, then the \u0026lt;cbvar\u0026gt; argument must also be passed.\n\u0026lt;cbvar\u0026gt; - The fldname that defines the CB Var Group that you want the running total for. This is an optional argument as long as the \u0026lt;CBNAME\u0026gt; argument is not used.

This argument must always be specified.\nReturns sys.get_tot() can return integer or float. Since any value is valid for a tot, there is no way to return a unique bad value, however sys.get_tot() will try to return a bad value when necessary. A bad return for a float is -1.0, and a bad ret for an integer is -1. Thus the following may be considered bad returns sometimes, but they could also be perfectly valid.\n-1.0 - OR -1 - Either \u0026lt;CBNAME\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;cbvar\u0026gt;, or \u0026lt;cbtot\u0026gt; is invalid. AnyValue - The current running total of the CB TOT Var for specified CB and CB Var Group.\nWhere Used sys.get_tot() can be called from anywhere as long as there is an active driver with \u0026lt;CBNAME\u0026gt; set appropriately to either CB_DRPROC or CB_DRSEL.\nExample The following example gets the current running total for the CB TOT Var sys.pr_syssize for the current CB Var/EOF Group for the current CB.\ntot = sys.get_tot(sys.pr_syssize); Description sys.get_tot() returns the current running total of a CB TOT Var for a CB Var/EOF Group for a particular CB. It can be called with 1, 2, or 3 arguments.\nIf called with 1 arg, the arg is \u0026lt;cbtot\u0026gt;. sys.get_tot() will return the current running total of the CB TOT Var for the Current CB Var/EOF Group for the current CB.\nIf used with 2 args, the args are \u0026lt;cbvar\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;cbtot\u0026gt;. sys.get_tot() will return the current running total of the CB TOT Var for the specified CB Var Group for the current CB. You may want to use sys.get_tot() in this manner if you need to access a CB TOT Var of a particular CB Var Group for the current CB outside of the current CB Var Group.\nIf used with 3 args, the args are \u0026lt;CBNAME\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;cbvar\u0026gt;, and \u0026lt;cbtot\u0026gt;. sys.get_tot() will return the running total of the CB TOT Var for the specified CB Var for the specified CB. You may want to use sys.get_tot() in this manner if you need to access a CB TOT Var for a particular CB Var Group of any CB outside of the processing for that CB.\nThus, you can get a running total for any CB TOT Var for any CB Var Group for any currently active CB from any PCL.\nIn order to get a running total of a CB TOT Var for the CB EOF Group outside of the CB EOF Group processing, you need to call sys.get_gtot() instead of sys.get_tot().\n4C maintains running totals for each CB TOT Var that was defined as TOT for each CB Var group and for the CB EOF Group. This value is updated after the rcd has been CB Selected and before running the DRSELECT or DRPROC PCL. After a CB is processed, the running totals of all CB TOT Vars for each CB Var Group at the same or lower level than the triggering group are set to NULL.

This is the field in the 4C application that will be used for importing and exporting the data. When data is imported, this field will have the value of the imported data. When exporting data, the value in this field is formatted and exported to the external application.\n\u0026lt;flags\u0026gt; - can be combinations of:\nLD_ONETIME - Link to this data once only and either. Get or Set the data and close the connection immediately. If you use LD_ONETIME, you do not need to call sys.close_ldata(). LD_AUTOMATIC - This will automatically update the data in the 4C application without the application needing to call sys.get_ldata() explicitly. This is the default if neither LD_ONDEMAND or LD_AUTOMATIC are specified. LD_ONDEMAND - Opposite of LD_AUTOMATIC. This instructs 4C to send data to the 4C application only when it explicitly asks for it with sys.get_ldata(). LD_GET - Tells 4C that this LData is to be read from the external process. It is OK to use LD_GET and LD_SET together. If neither LD_GET or LD_SET is specified, then LD_GET is assumed. When LD_ONETIME is set along with LD_GET, then sys.open_ldata() call does not return until the data is retrieved from the external application. LD_SET - Tells 4C that this LData will be written to the external application. When LD_ONETIME is set along with LD_SET, then sys.open_ldata() call does not return until the data is written to the external application. LD_DEFAULT - With no other flags, implies LD_AUTOMATIC|LD_GET. \u0026lt;opts\u0026gt; - Alpha vars of the form \u0026ldquo;App=\u0026rdquo;.

The last 12 parameters can all be used for specifying these options.\nReturns 0 - Success.\n-1 = Failure and sys.errno will be set.\nWhere Used sys.open_ldata() can be called from anywhere. For system wide LData connections that need to stay open, you will probably want to start this in a daemon process.\nExample There is a program in the bootstrap directory that you can look at to see how a connection to a spreadsheet may be set up. The program ldata.tst.1 links 10 different SysScratch 4c fields to 10 different cells in the spreadsheet /test/xx.xls. It uses the \u0026ldquo;testdde\u0026rdquo; record in the s_ldatah fileh. If you use this example, you will need to modify at least, the sldh_server and sldh_topic fields for the \u0026ldquo;testdde\u0026rdquo; rcd.\nDescription Use sys.open_ldata() to open LData connections with external processes. The LData connection will remain open for as long as \u0026lt;field\u0026gt; is in memory. If it is not in a SysScratch file, and the program that has this field in memory exits, then the LData connection is closed automatically. Onetime LData links are automatically closed after the sys.open_ldata() call. You can explicitly close an open LData connection using sys.close_ldata().\nBugs / Features / Comments You cannot specify more than one item/field in a sys.open_ldata() call. This makes startup of a connection with many items slow. If this is a problem, I will look for a way around it.\nSee Also sys.get_ldata() sys.set_ldata() sys.close_ldata() "

It may also be called during EndPage PCL processing.\nExample if (sys.page_isfull()) sys.page(); Description sys.page() causes the current device to go to top of form, or to print \u0026lt;skips\u0026gt; blank lines. For a crt, this means prompting to continue, and then clearing the current window of the crt only. For other devices, this means putting out a form feed character, or enough blank lines to reach the next top of form. The current page number of the device is incremented. If the current device is already at the top of form, then sys.page() does not do anything. After a call to sys.page(), all calls to sys.is_tof() will return 1 until something has printed on the new page, or until sys.skip() has been called. After that, sys.is_tof() will return 0 until the next sys.page() call.\nThe \u0026lt;nskips\u0026gt; can be used to make label printing and things like that easier. Other than printing \u0026lt;nskips\u0026gt; blank lines, everything else acts the same. The internal page counter is incremented etc.\nThis PCL acts only on the current device. The current device is usually the device defined for the current program. However, if the current program has not finished executing the InitPCL, or the current program has already started executing the EndPCL, then the current device is the device used by the most recently active program that has made it past the InitPCL, but not as far as the EndPCL.\nThis PCL can be called from scrolling or from non-scrolling programs, from programs that print and from those that do not print.\nFrom non-scrolling programs, the most likely place to call sys.page() is from the InitPCL, the EndPCL, or the ExitPCL. If called at any of these places, you should make sure that the device has been opened by some calling program. It could also be called from the SFldLpPCL or the EFldLpPCL. It does not make very much sense to call sys.page() from any of the fld PCL statements.\nsys.page() could be called from a non-printing program almost anywhere that that program would be pushing a different program that prints. Once again, you would need to be sure that the non-printing program had the device open.\nThe most common use of sys.page() is in scrolling programs. Here, the most likely place to call it is from the SPagePCL, or the EPage PCL. When called from either of these two places there are no funny timing considerations. If called from other places, there are timing issues to consider. First, it should not be called from the SFldLpPCL, or any field PCL. The two other likely places to call sys.page() from are the EFldLp PCL and the DrProcPCL. If called from either of these two PCLs, 4C will set the next driver state to be StartPage. The next action 4C will take after completing the current PCL will be to execute the SPagePCL. The current PCL, including all nested PCLs, will execute until finished, but no further printing of records will occur on the current page. If this is the DrProc PCL, this means that the current record has not been printed yet, and will be printed on the next page. In order to accomplish this, 4C sets the next record ptr to the current record. In other words, the next record processed is the current record, and the DrProc PCL will actually execute twice for this record. This must be kept in mind when calculating totals and things like that in the DrProcPCL. If you are calculating totals in the DrProc PCL, and you call sys.page() also, you should exit the PCL with a return statement before updating your totals.\nBugs / Features / Comments If called from the Program DrProc PCL, the DrProc PCL will execute a 2nd time for the current rcd.

This will only happen after all nested PCLs are exited normally. The next field to process will be sys.cur_field if no input was entered on that field. If input was entered, then the next field to process will be sys.cur_field + 1.\nsys.mode can be reset to \u0026ldquo;Lookup\u0026rdquo; by pressing the key, or if XLMODETOGGLE is \u0026ldquo;ON\u0026rdquo;, by calling sys.set_add() again.\nThe main effect of calling sys.set_add() is that the system variable sys.mode in \u0026lsquo;$syslocalf\u0026rsquo; is set to \u0026ldquo;Add\u0026rdquo;.

Currently, this is the only value returned.\nWhere Used Normally this is used by the system dbg programs when a developer is doing interactive debugging of a 4c session. However, an application may want to set breakpoints on its own without user control when they use their own program for debugging some exceptional conditions. When used this way, the env var FC_DBGMAIN should be set to the application program that should run when breakpoints are encountered.\nExample sys.set_break() is useful for applications that need to debug seldom encountered issues that are rarely duplicatable. One scenario for this is to set a breakpoint on the SysPCL sys.upd_file() specifying BRK_ENTRY. Then in the application program referenced by FC_DBGMAIN, check for the conditions that you are looking for, such as a value in a file changing to a specific value and if that condition is met, call sys.app_trace() to create a complete trace of the current state of the 4c session and then somehow inform the developer via email or text message that the trace was created so someone can look into it. When used this way, the breakpoint is handled by the application program and there should be no end user interaction. The end user will not notice anything different than normal. Unless specifically cleared with sys.clr_break(), breakpoints remain in effect across the entire 4c session.\nDescription In order for the application to run its own program when a breakpoint is required, the env var FC_DBGMAIN must be set correctly and the 4C Server version must be 6.4.3 or later.\nBugs / Features / Comments None\nSee Also sys.clr_break() "

The next field to process will be sys.cur_field if no input was entered on that field.

The StartFldLp PCL is used to turn \u0026ldquo;so\u0026rdquo; mode off for each of the 6 menu labels, and for the prompt field.

This PCL highlights the selection by setting \u0026ldquo;so\u0026rdquo; on, changes the prompt, and highlights the prompt as well. The code that does this follows:\nif (dbgsel == 1) sys.set_dfattr(SEL1,\u0026#34;so\u0026#34;); else if (dbgsel == 2) sys.set_dfattr(SEL2,\u0026#34;so\u0026#34;); else if (dbgsel == 3) sys.set_dfattr(SEL3,\u0026#34;so\u0026#34;); else if (dbgsel == 4) sys.set_dfattr(SEL4,\u0026#34;so\u0026#34;); else if (dbgsel == 5) sys.set_dfattr(SEL5,\u0026#34;so\u0026#34;); else if (dbgsel == 6) sys.set_dfattr(SEL6,\u0026#34;so\u0026#34;); prompt = \u0026#34; Selection OK? \u0026#34;; sys.set_dfattr(PROMPT,\u0026#34;so\u0026#34;); ok = \u0026#39;y\u0026#39; Each possibility was tested separately to allow the insertion of display fields later without affecting the code.\nDescription sys.set_dfattr() allows you to control the display attributes of a report display field at run time. The attributes that you can set or unset are the same that can be defined for the field in the sys.df.maint programs. The way you specify the display field to this PCL is by its label. That is, the label defined in sys.dpy_field. This most often will be upper case letters. When a program is compiled, this label is converted to an integer. It always has the value of one less than its field number. If there are n display fields in the program, then the numbers for these fields will vary from 0 to n-1. Thus you could use a for loop to set all display fields between LABEL1 and LABELN. If you wanted to do this, then the code would look like the following:\nfor (dfnum = LABEL1; dfnum \u0026lt; LABELN; dfnum += 1) sys.set_dfattr(dfnum,\u0026#34;so\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;no ul\u0026#34;); Each of the attributes corresponds to a rcd in \\dev_cap under \\user, except for the default and no default attributes. The attributes correspond to the \\dc_longname field. If you specify \u0026ldquo;no default\u0026rdquo;, this means that you want to set exactly those attributes specified and leave ALL other attributes off. If you specify \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo;, it means to set or unset the attributes specified, but to leave any others specified in the display field definition on. If you specify neither \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; nor \u0026ldquo;no default\u0026rdquo;, it is the same as specifying \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo;.\nBugs / Features / Comments If you specify an integer instead of a display field label, there is no check to make sure it is within range of the display field numbers. If it is not, you probably get a segment fault or some other very nasty error.\nSee Also sys.set_dfoption() "

The INIT PCL for this program sets the prompts for the days and the input field for the days to no echo if those days are not possible to schedule on. In addition, the input field is set to display only. Thus, you may be prompted for all days of the week, or only for monday and tuesday, or something like that. The code that does this follows:\nif (as_us_daysel[6] != \u0026#39;y\u0026#39;) { sys.set_dfoption(PMONDAY,\u0026#34;ne\u0026#34;); sys.set_dfoption(MONDAY,\u0026#34;ne\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;do\u0026#34;); } if (as_us_daysel[0] != \u0026#39;y\u0026#39;) { sys.set_dfoption(PTUESDAY,\u0026#34;ne\u0026#34;); sys.set_dfoption(TUESDAY,\u0026#34;ne\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;do\u0026#34;); } if (as_us_daysel[1] != \u0026#39;y\u0026#39;) { sys.set_dfoption(PWEDNESDAY,\u0026#34;ne\u0026#34;); sys.set_dfoption(WEDNESDAY,\u0026#34;ne\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;do\u0026#34;); } if (as_us_daysel[2] != \u0026#39;y\u0026#39;) { sys.set_dfoption(PTHURSDAY,\u0026#34;ne\u0026#34;); sys.set_dfoption(THURSDAY,\u0026#34;ne\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;do\u0026#34;); } if (as_us_daysel[3] != \u0026#39;y\u0026#39;) { sys.set_dfoption(PFRIDAY,\u0026#34;ne\u0026#34;); sys.set_dfoption(FRIDAY,\u0026#34;ne\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;do\u0026#34;); } if (as_us_daysel[4] != \u0026#39;y\u0026#39;) { sys.set_dfoption(PSATURDAY,\u0026#34;ne\u0026#34;); sys.set_dfoption(SATURDAY,\u0026#34;ne\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;do\u0026#34;); } if (as_us_daysel[5] != \u0026#39;y\u0026#39;) { sys.set_dfoption(PSUNDAY,\u0026#34;ne\u0026#34;); sys.set_dfoption(SUNDAY,\u0026#34;ne\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;do\u0026#34;); } The following demo programs show different ways that \u0026ldquo;ignore\u0026rdquo; works with Panel List programs and Panel ListView programs.\ndtf.lv2.s - Run this program to see a Panel ListView program and a Panel List program embedded in a layout. dtf.lv.2 - Run this program standalone to see a Panel ListView program run in its own layout. dtf.list.2 - Run this program to a Panel List program run in its own layout. Both the Panel List program and the Panel ListView program prompt to let you decide whether 2 of the list items should be set to \u0026ldquo;ignore\u0026rdquo; in the InitPCL, the OpenPCL, or not at all. It is worthwhile to notice the differences.\nDescription sys.set_dfoption() allows you to control some of the options of a display field at run time. The options that you can control are listed above. The way you specify the display field to this PCL is by its label. That is, the label defined in sys.dpy_field. This most often will be upper case letters. When a program is compiled, this label is converted to an integer. It always has the value of one less than its field number. If there are n display fields in the program, then the numbers for these fields will vary from 0 to n-1. Thus you could use a for loop to set all display fields between LABEL1 and LABELN. If you wanted to do this, then the code would look like the following:\nfor (dfnum = LABEL1; dfnum \u0026lt; LABELN; dfnum += 1) sys.set_dfoption(dfnum,\u0026#34;do\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;ne\u0026#34;); Most of the options correspond to a flag in sys.dpy_field, that can be set in the display field settings. The settings here are considered the \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; options and unless one of \u0026ldquo;no default\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;merge\u0026rdquo; is specified, the options to sys.set_dfoption are combined with all the other \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; options.\nIf you specify \u0026ldquo;no default\u0026rdquo;, this means that you want to set exactly those flags and leave ALL other flags unset. If you specify \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo;, it means to set or unset the flags specified, but to leave the others as specified in the display field definition. If you specify neither \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; nor \u0026ldquo;no default\u0026rdquo;, it is the same as specifying \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;merge\u0026rdquo; is useful in the cases where you make multiple calls to sys.set_dfoption and do not want to undo the previous settings.\nIf a Panel ListView item or Panel List item is set to \u0026ldquo;ignore\u0026rdquo; in the InitPCL it cannot later be set to \u0026ldquo;no ignore\u0026rdquo;. If a Panel ListView item is set to \u0026ldquo;ignore\u0026rdquo; in the InitPCL, then extra white space is removed from the layout if possible.\nBugs / Features / Comments A field that you want to change to and from DO must not be defined as DO in sys.dpy_field. It can be defined as an input field and then set to display only in the INIT PCL.\nIf you specify an integer instead of a display field label, there is no check to make sure it is within range of the display field numbers. If it is not, you probably get a segment fault or some other very nasty error.\n\u0026ldquo;inpselall\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;inpselstart\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;inpselend\u0026rdquo;, require both the 4csrvr and the 4cclient to be at version 4.8.1 or higher.\n\u0026ldquo;inpstripfmt\u0026rdquo; requires the 4csrvr to be at version 4.8.1 or higher.\nSee Also sys.set_dfattr() "

It can be used to enable auto sequencing of the driver file, to allow the renumbering cmd to be used in sys.dr_epedit(), and to allow interleaving of sorting and processing of records. It can also be used to disable any of these three options, however, this is not of much use yet. The options may be or\u0026rsquo;d together. The DR_INTERLEAVE option is incompatible with both DR_RENUMBER and with DR_AUTOSEQ. Using DR_DEFAULT sets the driver options to the default driver options specified in the driver definition screen.\nWhen DR_INTERLEAVE is specified, 4C will sort and select only enough records to display one screenfull of data at a time. The timing is different when using this option. Some Driver Proc PCLs will be interleaved with the Driver Sort/Select PCLs. The Driver End Sort PCL may be executed after some Driver Proc PCL\u0026rsquo;s. The advantage of using this option with some screens is so that the user does not need to wait a long time to build the temp file before seeing a screen full of data. The temp file will still be built. This option is meant for screen drivers.\nWhen the program driver characteristics allow a flag to specify DR_INTERLEAVE, the DR_NOINTERLEAVE option can be used in the Driver Init PCL to disable interleave.\nThe DR_AUTOSEQ option directs 4C to automatically sequence the driver file. When used, you cannot use DR_INTERLEAVE. After building the temp file, if 4C detects any records out of sequence, they are sequenced immediately. If the program uses sys.dr_epedit(), then deleting records causes immediate resequencing. If records are deleted in any other manner than through sys.dr_epedit(), the records will not be resequenced. However, there is no problem with missing sequence numbers. The next time a driver that autosequences is run with that file, the records will be resequenced. Records can only be inserted using sys.dr_epedit(). Inserting records first causes all records following the place of insertion to be resequenced with as high a sequence as possible. So, the user does not need to specify how many records he wants to insert. When ending insert mode, 4C will resequence any records that need to be resequenced. No conversion is necessary on any files whose last primary key can be used as a sequence number. Also, not all drivers that use a sequenced file need to enable autosequencing. Any length sequence number can be used, except it MUST be an alpha storage type. 4C will left fill the sequence number with zero\u0026rsquo;s when it calculates it. When adding, right now you need to set the sequence number yourself, but later 4C will do it automatically. To set, use the Start Fld PCL and a statement like:\nseq = sys.fmt_integer(dr_sequence,\u0026#34;9999\u0026#34;); When the program driver characteristics allow a flag to specify DR_AUTOSEQ, the DR_NOAUTOSEQ option can be used in the Driver Init PCL to disable the autosequencing.\nThe DR_RENUMBER option is a flag that signals sys.dr_epedit() to allow the user to specify \u0026lsquo;r\u0026rsquo; as a command. The renumber cmd allows the user to renumber all or part of the selected rcds and to specify the increment to use when renumbering. See the section on modifications for using the renumber command within sys.dr_epedit(). When this option is used, the DR_INTERLEAVE option cannot be used, or it will be ignored.\nWhen the program driver characteristics allow a flag to specify DR_RENUMBER, the DR_NORENUMBER option can be used in the Driver Init PCL to disable renumbering.\nBugs / Features / Comments None\nSee Also sys.dr_epedit() "

When called, 4C first checks to see if the XLMODETOGGLE var is set to ON. If it is and sys.mode is already \u0026ldquo;Modify\u0026rdquo;, 4C sets it back to \u0026ldquo;Lookup\u0026rdquo;. If it is anything else, then 4C sets sys.mode to \u0026ldquo;Modify\u0026rdquo;. Next, 4C checks to see if it is in a field processing state. If so, then the next field state is set to exit that field. This will only happen after all nested PCLs are exited normally. The next field to process will be sys.cur_field if no input was entered on that field. If input was entered, then the next field to process will be sys.cur_field + 1.\nsys.mode can be reset to \u0026ldquo;Lookup\u0026rdquo; by pressing the key, or if XLMODETOGGLE is \u0026ldquo;ON\u0026rdquo;, by calling sys.set_mod() again.\nThe main effect of calling sys.set_mod() is that the system variable sys.mode in \u0026lsquo;$syslocalf\u0026rsquo; is set to \u0026ldquo;Modify\u0026rdquo;. This affects calls to sys.read_file() with the F_DEFAULT flag. Since sys.mode is in the local system file, this only affects the current program.\nCurrently, there are no other side effects of calling sys.set_mod() but I would advise not to call it except during field processing.\nBugs / Features / Comments There is no corresponding sys.set_look() PCL.\nSee Also sys.set_add() sys.set_del() sys.read_file() "

      "content": "1. What is 4C Software? 4C Software is a proprietary, full-stack enterprise application development and runtime platform designed for building and running mission-critical business systems. It provides a complete ecosystem — including its own programming language, database engine, security framework, client interface, and deployment tools — all tightly integrated into a unified architecture.\nRather than being just a programming language or just a database, 4C is an entire application platform. Organizations use it to develop custom line-of-business systems such as inventory management, accounting, distribution control, logistics tracking, customer management, reporting, and transaction-heavy enterprise workflows.\nIt belongs to the class of platforms often compared to classic 4GL environments (like PowerBuilder or Progress OpenEdge), but with deeper control over runtime execution, file systems, and security.\n2. Architectural Philosophy At its core, 4C follows a centralized client–server model:\nThe server executes all application logic. The client is primarily responsible for user interface rendering. Data integrity, transaction control, locking, and security are handled server-side. This architecture ensures:\nStrong multi-user consistency Controlled record locking Centralized security enforcement Predictable performance under concurrent load The client acts as a graphical terminal, while the server manages sessions, file access, transaction logs, and application execution.\n3. Core Building Blocks The platform is composed of several tightly integrated components:\n1. PCL (Procedure Call Language) A proprietary server-side programming language used to write business logic. It includes:\nFile handling Embedded SQL Encryption and security primitives UI control Networking utilities System-level operations 2. JISAM File System 4C’s native indexed file system optimized for transactional, multi-user access. It supports both 32-bit and 64-bit formats and includes built-in recovery, repair, and backup tools.\n3. CISAM Support Integration with Informix C-ISAM for transactional file management in earlier or specialized configurations.\n4. External Database Integration Connectivity to:\nMySQL / MariaDB PostgreSQL SQLite ODBC-based systems (including Microsoft SQL Server) This allows 4C applications to interact with modern relational databases while preserving native application logic.\n5. Security Framework Enterprise-grade features including:\nRole-based access control Record and field-level encryption RSA and symmetric encryption Secure client-server communication PAM authentication (Linux) Host key identity model 4. Platform Scope 4C is not just a development toolkit — it is an application runtime environment. It includes:\nSession management Logging and profiling tools Transaction monitoring Record lock inspection Source control Auto-update mechanisms PDF generation JSON handling REST communication support Everything required to build, deploy, secure, and maintain enterprise software is contained within the platform.\n5. Target Use Cases 4C is designed for:\nHigh-concurrency business applications Transaction-heavy systems Custom enterprise solutions Industry-specific vertical software Long-running operational systems with strict data consistency requirements It is particularly well-suited for environments where reliability, control, and multi-user data integrity are more important than modern web-first architecture trends.\n6. Why It Matters Despite being a mature and long-standing platform, 4C continues to evolve, supporting modern operating systems (including Win64 and macOS clients) and updated cryptographic standards.\nIts longevity suggests:\nA stable enterprise customer base Proven architecture for real-world operations Strong backward compatibility Ongoing maintenance and feature development 4C represents a traditional but powerful approach to enterprise application engineering — emphasizing stability, centralized control, and integrated system design over distributed or microservice-based complexity.\nClosing Perspective This chapter provides a high-level orientation to the 4C ecosystem. In the chapters that follow, we will explore:\nThe internal architecture in depth The PCL language structure and programming model JISAM file internals and transaction handling Security mechanisms and cryptographic operations External database connectivity Application monitoring and profiling Real-world development workflows Understanding 4C requires viewing it not as a single tool, but as a complete enterprise software environment — one designed to build and run serious business systems at scale.\n"
