sys.dr_epskip()

### sys.dr_epskip()

Purpose:

sys.dr_epskip() skips lines at scrolling prog EndPage.

Usage:

ret = sys.dr_epskip(\<count\>);

Arguments:

integer \<count\> - Number of lines to skip. Should be greater than 0.

Returns:

integer \<ret\>

0 - Currently this is the only return.

Where Used:

sys.dr_epskip() can be called only from the EndPage PCL of scrolling
programs.

Example:

Description:

This PCL skips \<count\> lines for a scrolling program. It should only
be called during the EndPage PCL processing. sys.dr_epskip() works like
sys.page() except that \<count\> lines are skipped instead of doing a
page break. It can be used when printing labels or when you want to do
your own line counting.

Bugs/Features/Comments:

This PCL is obsolete and may be removed without notice. Instead, you
should use the bootstrap fields to define the page layout, or in special
cases, use the \<nskips\> arg to sys.page().
