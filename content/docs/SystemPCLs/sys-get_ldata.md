## sys.get_ldata()
### Purpose
`sys.get_ldata()` requests data from an open LData connection.

### Usage
```c
ret = sys.get_ldata(<ldname>, <flags>);
```

### Arguments
`<ldname>` - an alpha var that was used in a previous call to `sys.open_ldata()`

`<flags>` - can be one of:
- LD_DEFAULT - Using LD_DEFAULT, `sys.get_ldata()` will not return until the data has been retrieved or an error has been returned from the external process.
- LD_NOWAIT - Request the data but don't wait for it before returning. Using LD_NOWAIT is faster but your application will not know exactly when the data has been retrieved.

### Returns
-1 = Failure and `sys.errno` will be set. Probably no open LData connection with name `<ldname>`.

0 - Success

### Where Used
`sys.get_ldata()` can be called from anywhere. If you specified LD_AUTOMATIC, you won't normally need to call `sys.get_ldata()` since your application will be sent the data as it changes anyway.

### Example
None

### Description
Use `sys.get_ldata()` to get data from non onetime non automatic LData connections with external processes. The data will be returned into the field specified in the `sys.open_ldata()` call.
