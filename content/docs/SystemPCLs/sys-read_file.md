## sys.read_file()
### Purpose
`sys.read_file()` accesses a record in a file.

### Usage
```c
ret = sys.read_file(<file>, <flags> [, <keyno>]);
```

### Arguments
file `<file>` - The asfile name of the file you are reading.

integer `<flags>` - Any number of predefined flags that can be combined using the '|' operator. See below for flag descriptions.

integer `<keyno>` - optional arg that allows specification of key number to read by. The primary key number is 0, first secondary key 1, etc.

Allowable flags are:
- F_DEFAULT - read based on `sys.mode`. If error, `sys.next_field` will be set to `sys.cur_field`. This flag is only used by screen programs that allow user setting of `sys.mode` through the function keys. It is normally used only on the main file of the screen program.
- F_CONTINUE - If specified with F_DEFAULT in a non scrolling program and `sys.mode` is either "Lookup" or "Delete" continue processing all fields without prompting for input. Without F_CONTINUE, the 4C program would skip to the EndFldLoop processing for "Delete" and jump back to the first field for "Lookup".
- F_ADD - read in add mode. Rcd will be locked unless F_NOLOCK specified. Unless F_NODEBLOCK or F_OVERRIDE specified, data fields are cleared. Error if rcd exists unless F_MODIFY flag specified also.
- F_DELETE - read assuming record will be deleted. Unless F_NOLOCK specified, rcd will be locked first. Error if rcd does not exist.
- F_MODIFY - read assuming record will be modified. Unless F_NOLOCK specified, rcd will be locked first. Unless F_NODEBLOCK specified, data fields are updated. Error if rcd does not exist unless F_ADD specified also.
- F_VERIFY - read to verify rcd exists, but do not copy data into any fields. Unless F_LOCK specified rcd will not be locked. Error if record does not exist and `sys.next_field` will be set to `sys.cur_field`.
- F_VERIFYNE - read to verify rcd does not exist but do not clear data from data fields or set new data into them. Unless F_LOCK specified rcd will not be locked. Error if record exists and `sys.next_field` will be set to `sys.cur_field`.
- F_LOOKUP - read in lookup mode. Unless F_LOCK specified rcd will not be locked. Unless F_NODEBLOCK specified, data fields are updated. Error if rcd does not exist.
- F_NOMSG - suppresses default error messages so you can supply your own.
- F_NOLOCK - suppress default rcd locking even for update modes.
- F_LOCK - Force rcd locking even in non-update modes.
- F_OVERRIDE - Leave data fields untouched for F_ADD.
- F_WAIT - When locking, wait for lock rather than return error.
- F_KEYEQ - Read exact key only - THIS IS THE DEFAULT.
- F_KEYGEQ - If exact key not there, read next rcd with key greater.
- F_KEYLEQ - If exact key not there, read prev rcd with key less.
- F_KEYGT - Read next rcd with key greater than current key val.
- F_KEYLT - Read prev rcd less than current key val.
- F_SEQNEXT - Read next sequential rcd.
- F_SEQPREV - Read prev sequential rcd.
- F_DRNEXT - Equivalent to F_SEQNEXT except that if no `<keyno>` var is specified, it will use the `<keyno>` used in `sys.dr_init()` or `sys.seek_key()`. This is useful when using `sys.dr_init()` or `sys.seek_key()` to initiate sequential reading of a file without actually using `sys.run_driver()`.
- F_NODEBLOCK - Do not update or clear data fields.

### Returns
0 - File accessed OK.

-1 - Some Error - Depends on mode and error code set in `sys.errno`.

The values `sys.errno` may have are:
1 - Record Not Found
2 - Cannot Lock Record
3 - Record Already Exists

### Where Used
`sys.read_file()` can be called from anywhere. Normally when using the F_DEFAULT flag, `sys.read_file()` will be called from an EndField PCL of a screen program to access the main file of that screen.

### Example
There are many examples of `sys.read_file()` in the tutorial application. Some of them are listed below.

```c
/* from global PCL cm_read */
cm_code = cmcode;
if (sys.read_file(cust_mstr,F_LOOKUP|F_NOMSG) < 0) {
    if (cm_code == "")
        return(1); /* Return 1 for null cmcode */
    return(-1);
}
return(0);
```

```c
/* from op.call.de.sel addcall() */
while (1) {
    if (sys.read_file(call_hdr,F_ADD|F_NOMSG|F_NODEBLOCK) < 0) {
        if (sys.errno == 3) { /* Rcd Already Exists */
            ch_num += 1;        /* Try for next */
            continue;
        }
        /* Different error - msg and exit PCL */
        sys.err_msg("Error Trying to Add - TRY AGAIN");
        return;
    }
    break;
}
```

### Description
`sys.read_file()` is the main way to access files in 4C. You can also use `sys.run_driver()` to read files sequentially, but to read a file by exact key, you must use `sys.read_file()`. Basically `sys.read_file()` reads a rcd in a file using an optional keynumber (0 by default) and a set flags. The flags determine most of what `sys.read_file()` does and they are described above. `sys.read_file()` can read sequentially or by key and may indicate that a rcd will be updated later by specifying an update mode.

Requirements

F_CONTINUE requires 4csrvr version 4.6.2 or higher.
