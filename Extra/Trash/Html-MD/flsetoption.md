sys.fl_setoption()

### sys.fl_setoption()

Purpose:

sys.fl_setoption() allows the application to set one or more file
options at runtime

Usage:

ret = sys.fl_setoption(\<asfile\>,\<optname\>, \<optval\>
\[,\<optname\>, \<optval\> ...\];\
\
or ret = sys.fl_setoption(\<asfile\>,\<optname=optval\>
\[,\<optname=optval\> ...\];\
\

Arguments:

asfile \<asfile\> - The asfile that is having the options set

alpha \<optname\> - The options being set. Current supported options are
"ExtName", "ExtType", "AccType", and "AccessType". "AccessType" and
"AccType" are synonyms.

alpha \<optval\> - The value the option should be set to. See the
description below for valid values of \<optval\> for each \<optname\>

Returns:

integer \<ret\> - The number of options actually set is returned. The
number of invalid options is returned in sys_ret. If no options were
set, -1 is returned and sys_ret is set to SYSRET_ERROR.

Where Used:

sys.fl_setoption() can be called from anywhere

Example:

Description:

sys.fl_setoption() allows the application to set one or more file
options at runtime Option names and values are specified as pairs that
are either individual arguments such as "name1","val1","name2","val2" or
combined like "name1=val1","name2=val2", etc.\
\
If \<asfile\> is currently open, it is first closed by
sys.fl_setoption() even if no options end up being set.\
\
Current options that are modifiable by the application in at least some
scenarios are

- "ExtName" - This the external name for the file. It is settable for
  all file access types under all circumstances and is equivalent to the
  sys.set_extfname() SysPCL. It is ok too set this to the empty string
  which will cause the file to use it's default external name.
- "AccType" or "AccessType" - The access type of a file can only be
  changed to one of "4C", "JISAM64", or "External" and only if the
  current access type is also one those types. Trying to change the
  access type of a "FixSeq", "VarSeq", or "CISAM" file is not supported.
- "ExtType" - You can change the ExtType of External files only. If you
  are changing a non external access type file to an external access
  type and want to set the ExtType also, you must change the access type
  to external first, either in the same call to sys.fl_setoption() or in
  an earlier call. Setting the ExtType of a file in sys.fl_setoption()
  is equivalent to calling sys.set_exttype(\<asfile\>, \<exttype\>)

Requirements
