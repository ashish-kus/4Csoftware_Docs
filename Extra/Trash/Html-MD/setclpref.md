sys.set_clpref()

### sys.set_clpref()

Purpose:

sys.set_clpref() allows the application to modify a client preference.

Usage:

ret =
sys.set_clpref(\<prefflags\>,\<prefstring\>\[,\<prefstring\>\]...);

Arguments:

integer \<prefflags\> - This can be either PREF_CURRENTUSER or
PREF_ALLUSERS, possibly combined with PREF_SAVE.

Returns:

integer \<ret\>

0 - OK

-1 - Error, probably client version earlier than 4.4.4

Where Used:

sys.set_clpref() can be called from anywhere during an interactive
client session.\
\
However, the client preferences really are for the client to choose and
set. Except under extraordinary circumstances, you should not change
client preferences for them without their interaction.\
\

Example:

sys.set_clpref(PREF_CURRENTUSER\|PREF_SAVE,"FontFileList=4csfont-1.txt);

Description:

sys.set_clpref() allows the application to modify client preferences.
You can modify preferences specific to the current user or for all
users. This should be used only under special circumstances. If you want
the preferences to be saved, then also specify PREF_SAVE as part of the
\<prefflags\> argument. If PREF_SAVE is not specified, the modified
preferences will not be saved permanently unless some subsequent call to
sys.set_clpref() specifies PREF_SAVE or unless the user calls up the
preferences dialog and saves them that way. You can set multiple
preferences by specifying multiple \<prefstring\> args. Each
\<prefstring\> arg is in the format "PrefName=Val" where PrefName and
Val correspond to the names and values documented in: [Client
Preferences](../Config/cl-pref.html) In some cases, changing a client
preference does not take effect until the client exits and restarts. In
particular, modifying ConnFileList, FontFileList, or FKeyFileList
require the client to exit and restart to have any effect.

Requirements

sys.set_clpref() requires both client and server to be at version 4.4.4
or higher.

Bugs/Features/Comments:

sys.set_clpref() is not supported by the non interactive 4C client,
4ccl.

Specifying an incorrect \<prefstring\> is not detected as an error.

Do not assume that the current user has permission to write the All
Users cl-pref.txt file. No error is returned if PREF_SAVE is specified
and the user does not have permission to write the cl-pref.txt file.
