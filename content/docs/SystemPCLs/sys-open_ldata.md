## sys.open_ldata()
### Purpose
`sys.open_ldata()` opens a connection to linked data.

### Usage
```c
ret = sys.open_ldata(<ldname>,<ldkey>,<field>,<flags>[,<opt>...]);
```

### Arguments
`<ldname>` - an alpha var that can be used in subsequent calls to `sys.get_ldata()`, `sys.set_ldata()`, and `sys.close_ldata()`

`<ldkey>` - The key to the s_ldatah file.

`<field>` - Any type of field. This is the field in the 4C application that will be used for importing and exporting the data. When data is imported, this field will have the value of the imported data. When exporting data, the value in this field is formatted and exported to the external application.

`<flags>` - can be combinations of:
- LD_ONETIME - Link to this data once only and either. Get or Set the data and close the connection immediately. If you use LD_ONETIME, you do not need to call `sys.close_ldata()`.
- LD_AUTOMATIC - This will automatically update the data in the 4C application without the application needing to call `sys.get_ldata()` explicitly. This is the default if neither LD_ONDEMAND or LD_AUTOMATIC are specified.
- LD_ONDEMAND - Opposite of LD_AUTOMATIC. This instructs 4C to send data to the 4C application only when it explicitly asks for it with `sys.get_ldata()`.
- LD_GET - Tells 4C that this LData is to be read from the external process. It is OK to use LD_GET and LD_SET together. If neither LD_GET or LD_SET is specified, then LD_GET is assumed. When LD_ONETIME is set along with LD_GET, then `sys.open_ldata()` call does not return until the data is retrieved from the external application.
- LD_SET - Tells 4C that this LData will be written to the external application. When LD_ONETIME is set along with LD_SET, then `sys.open_ldata()` call does not return until the data is written to the external application.
- LD_DEFAULT - With no other flags, implies LD_AUTOMATIC|LD_GET.

`<opts>` - Alpha vars of the form "App=<app>". Multiple opts can be specified together by separating different options with a comma. Ex. "App=<app>,Topic=<topic>". The last 12 parameters can all be used for specifying these options.

### Returns
0 - Success.

-1 = Failure and `sys.errno` will be set.

### Where Used
`sys.open_ldata()` can be called from anywhere. For system wide LData connections that need to stay open, you will probably want to start this in a daemon process.

### Example
There is a program in the bootstrap directory that you can look at to see how a connection to a spreadsheet may be set up. The program `ldata.tst.1` links 10 different SysScratch 4c fields to 10 different cells in the spreadsheet `/test/xx.xls`. It uses the "testdde" record in the s_ldatah fileh. If you use this example, you will need to modify at least, the `sldh_server` and `sldh_topic` fields for the "testdde" rcd.

### Description
Use `sys.open_ldata()` to open LData connections with external processes. The LData connection will remain open for as long as `<field>` is in memory. If it is not in a SysScratch file, and the program that has this field in memory exits, then the LData connection is closed automatically. Onetime LData links are automatically closed after the `sys.open_ldata()` call. You can explicitly close an open LData connection using `sys.close_ldata()`.

### Bugs / Features / Comments
You cannot specify more than one item/field in a `sys.open_ldata()` call. This makes startup of a connection with many items slow. If this is a problem, I will look for a way around it.
