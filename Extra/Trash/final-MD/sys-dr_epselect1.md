## sys.dr_epselect1()
### Purpose
sys.dr_epselect1() does end page processing for select scrolling screens.

### Usage
```c
sys.dr_epselect1();
```

### Arguments
None

### Returns
None

### Where Used
sys.dr_epselect1() can be called ONLY from the EndPage PCL processing of a scrolling screen.

### Example
None

### Description
sys.dr_epselect1() is used for scrolling screens to allow the user to select 1 rcd. A rcd is selected by pressing the `<accept>` key when the rcd is highlighted. In addition, if the 4C environment variable, XLRETURN, is set to "SELECT", then the `<return>` key also selects the rcd. When a rcd has been selected, the current program exits, setting `$wexit_code` to 0. If the user cancels, then `$wexit_code` will be set to -1.

sys.dr_epselect1() provides a subset of the commands that sys.dr_epedit() provides. The commands are all 1 key commands and some of them accept a count also. They are:
```c
<accept> - Select rcd and exit program.
<return> - If XLRETURN is "SELECT" then same as accept,
           otherwise error
[count]G - GOTO rcd# - If count not specified, then GOTO
           last rcd.
<redisplay> - Redisplays screen
t or T   - Goto 1st rcd
b or B   - Goto last rcd
```
