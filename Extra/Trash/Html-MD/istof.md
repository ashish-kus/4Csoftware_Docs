sys.is_tof()

### sys.is_tof()

Purpose:

sys.is_tof() is used to determine if the current output device is at the
top of form or not.

Usage:

if (sys.is_tof()) dosomething();

Arguments:

None

Returns:

1 - Current output device is at top of form.

0 - Current output device is not at top of form.

There are no error returns.

Where Used:

sys.is_tof() is NORMALLY called from a StartPage PCL of a scrolling rpt
program, or from an init PCL of a non-scrolling rpt program. It is
usually used in together with sys.page_isfull() and sys.page(). It is
used to determine if headers need to be printed.

Example:

if (sys.is_tof()) sys.push_prog("rpt.pagehdr");

Description:

sys.is_tof() is called to determine if the current output device is at
top of form. Typically, sys.is_tof() is called to determine if page
headers and report headers need to be printed.\
\
sys.is_tof() can be called from any program, scrolling and
non-scrolling, printing and non-printing. The report output device needs
to be open.\
\
sys.is_tof() should be called instead of checking if sys.get_linenum()
\<= 1.\
\
Normally, sys.is_tof() would be called from the SPagePCL of a scrolling
program, or from the InitPCL of a non-scrolling program.\
\
After a call to sys.page(), calls to sys.is_tof() will return 1 until
something new is printed on the current output device, or until
sys.skip() is called. Thereafter, calls to sys.is_tof() will return 0
until the next call to sys.page().
