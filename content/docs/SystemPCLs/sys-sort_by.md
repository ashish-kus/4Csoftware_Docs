## sys.sort_by()
### Purpose
sys.sort_by() allows you to specify the order that driver rcds are sorted in.

### Usage
```c
ret = sys.sort_by(<asfile>,<fldcdef>,<sorttype>);
```

### Arguments
asfile `<asfile>` - The asfile name of the file containing the field to use in the sort.

integer `<fldcdef>` - The CDefine of the field in `<asfile>` to sort by.

integer `<sorttype>` - Either SORT_NORMAL or SORT_REVERSE.

### Returns
integer `<ret>`

0 - OK

-1 - No current driver, or current driver not in DRINIT state.

### Where Used
sys.sort_by() can be called ONLY from the DrInit PCL. It always applies to the current driver. It makes no difference where during the DrInit PCL that `sys.sort_by()` is called.

### Example
The following code is from the drinit() PCL in the an.call.de.sel program in the tutorial application.
```c
sys.sort_by(call_hdr,CH_DATE,SORT_REVERSE);
sys.sort_by(call_hdr,CH_TIME,SORT_REVERSE);
```

### Description
sys.sort_by() causes driver rcds to be sorted by the field specified in the `sys.sort_by()` statement. Multiple `sys.sort_by` statements can be used to sort by more than one field. The first `sys.sort_by()` statement specified has highest priority. If the field to sort by is not in the driver file, then it must be set in the DrSel PCL, possibly by reading another file.
