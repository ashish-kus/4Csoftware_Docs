## sys.lock_clientws()
### Purpose
sys.lock_clientws() locks the client workstation.

### Usage
```c
ret = sys.lock_clientws();
```

### Arguments
None

### Returns
0 - OK

-1 - Client version < 4.4.8

### Where Used
sys.lock_clientws() will normally be called when a client timeout has been caught and the application needs to protect the application data that may be visible on the client workstation.

### Example
If the demo application catches a client timeout, it runs the program lockws.1. This program gives the user 60 seconds to respond. If the user does not respond at all, then lockws.1 calls `sys.lock_clientws()` and then exits the lockws.1 program.

### Description
sys.lock_clientws() will lock the client workstation. Multiple calls to sys.lock_clientws() are OK. To unlock the workstation the user needs only enter the workstation passwd, which may be blank.

### Bugs / Features / Comments
sys.lock_clientws() requires the client to be running version 4.4.8 or higher.
