sys.rcd_changed()

### sys.rcd_changed()

Purpose:

sys.rcd_changed() indicates whether any of the fields in a rcd changed
since the last sys.read_file() call.

Usage:

ret = sys.rcd_changed(\<asfile\>);

Arguments:

\<asfile\> - the asfile name of the file you are checking

Returns:

-1 - Files last access was not a successful sys.read_file().

0 - Rcd has not changed since last sys.read_file() call.

1 - Rcd has changed since last sys.read_file() call.

Where Used:

sys.rcd_changed() can be called from anywhere but probably would be
called right before a call to sys.upd_file().

Example:

Description:

sys.rcd_changed() lets the program know if a rcd has changed since it
was read. If the file was opened with F_SAVEBUF, then no rereading of
the rcd is necessary. However, if F_SAVEBUF was not used, then the file
must be reread in order for the compare to be done. If you expect to
make lots of calls to sys.rcd_changed() for a particular file, it is
recommened that you open the file with F_SAVEBUF.
