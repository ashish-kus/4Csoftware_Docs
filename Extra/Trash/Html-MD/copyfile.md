sys.copy_file()

### sys.copy_file()

Purpose:

sys.copy_file() copys all fields from the data buffers of one file to
the data buffers of another.

Usage:

ret = sys.copy_file(\[ \<fromprog\>, \] \<fromfile\>, \[ \<toprog\>, \]
\<tofile\>);

Arguments:

alpha \<fromprog\> - Optional asprog name of the program to find
\<fromfile\> in. The default is the current program.

file \<fromfile\> - The asfile name of the file to copy from.

alpha \<toprog\> - Optional asprog name of the program to find
\<tofile\> in. The default is the current program.

file \<tofile\> - The asfile name of the file to copy to.

Returns:

0 - Always returns 0

Where Used:

sys.copy_file() can be called from anywhere.

Example:

Description:

sys.copy_file() copies all fields from one files buffer area to
anothers. This does not do any kind of file access or update. It is most
useful when the same file is used more than once in the same program. It
should not be used UNLESS the two files have the EXACT same file
definition. If it is, fields that do not match in data type are not
copied.

Bugs/Features/Comments:

Even after calling sys.copy_file() and then updating the rcd, the
primary key will still have the same values it had after the last file
access. This is because 4C always updates with the same primary key that
it last read with. To preserve the new key, the file should be read
after the call to sys.copy_file() using the F_VERIFY or F_VERIFYNE flag
to prevent overwriting of the data fields.
