## sys.get_linenum()
### Purpose
sys.get_linenum() returns the current line number.

### Usage
```c
linenum = sys.get_linenum();
```

### Arguments
None

### Returns
integer linenum - the current line number of the device being used by the current program.

### Where Used
sys.get_linenum() can be called from anywhere. It will often be used to be able to pass a row ofst to a pushed program.

### Example
The following example is from the tutorial program md.fm. In the callhelp() PCL, it uses `sys.get_linenum()` to be able to pass a row ofst to mhp.fm.
```c
push_prog("mhp.fm", itoa(sys.get_linenum()), "40");
```
NOTE: push_prog() is a global PCL in the tutorial directory.

### Description
sys.get_linenum() returns the current linenum of the currnt page of the device that the current program is printing on. This is meant as a replacement of the PCL "sys.line_number()". The reason for adding this PCL is that sys.line_number() sounds more like a variable name than a PCL. I think that by using PCLs that sound like verbs they are easier to remember. `sys.line_number()` will still work as before, but I would suggest using `sys.get_linenum()` instead. The current line number is defined as the last line that was used to print a field.

### Bugs / Features / Comments
If no fields have been printed on the current page, then `sys.get_linenum()` will return 0.
