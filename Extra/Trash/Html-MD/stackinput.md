sys.stack_input()

### sys.stack_input()

Purpose:

sys.stack_input() allows a program to stack input.

Usage:

ret = sys.stack_input(inp1 \[,inp2 \[,..., \[inp16\] \] ... \]);

Arguments:

inp1 - inp16 - Up to 16 alpha args\
\
inp1 is mandatory and inp2 through inp16 are optional.

Returns:

0 - OK

There are no error returns.

Where Used:

sys.stack_input() can be called from anywhere. Of course, it has no
affect until input is needed from the user.

Example:

The following could be used to cause a program to process the first
detail record associated with some header. The program would act just as
if the user had typed in "0001" followed by a \<CR\>.\
\
sys.stack_input("0001");

Description:

sys.stack_input() allows a program to stack input. Stacked input acts as
if the user entered that which is stacked in the same order it was
stacked. Each stacked input is followed by a \<CR\>. This is not really
a stack, it is a FirstIn FirstOut list. So successive stack input calls
are added to the end of the list rather than the head of the list. The
arguments passed to sys.stack_input() are also processed in the same
order. This can be used when you want to try to anticipate a users
response and save keystrokes. Calls to sys.stack_input() and
sys.stack_fkey() can be intermixed with predictable results.

Bugs/Features/Comments:

Every argument passed to sys.stack_input() gets a \<CR\> appended to it,
even though this is not always wanted.
