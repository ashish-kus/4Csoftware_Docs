## sys.auth_userpwd()
### Purpose
`sys.auth_userpwd()` uses the OS to authenticate a username/password on the server.

### Usage
```c
ret = sys.auth_userpwd(<username>,<passwd>);
```

### Arguments
- alpha `<username>`
- alpha `<password>`

### Returns
- 0 - User authenticated OK.
- -1 - User authentication failed.

### Where Used
`sys.auth_userpwd()` can be called from anywhere. Most common uses of `sys.auth_userpwd()` include unlocking the workstation and allowing access to privileged application programs.

### Example
See the lockscreen.s and getpwd.1 program in the demo application for an example.

### Description
`sys.auth_userpwd()` can be used to authenticate a username/password on the 4c server host. `sys.auth_userpwd()` sends a message to the 4csrvrd daemon program which uses the underlying OS security system to do the authentication. It is more secure to use `sys.auth_userpwd()` to verify a user's credentials than to use your own password mechanism. Another advantage of using `sys.auth_userpwd()` over maintaining your own passwd file is that there is no need to try to keep multiple passwords for the same user name in sync. `sys.auth_userpwd()` can be used with any username known to the OS. It is not necessary to use the currently authenticated user, though that is the more common case. `sys.auth_userpwd()` does not change the credentials of the current 4csrvr process in any way.

### Bugs / Features / Comments
When `sys.auth_userpwd()` fails, it is not possible to tell if the failure was due to expired passwd or invalid passwd.
