sys.split_string()

### sys.split_string()

Purpose:

sys.split_string() splits a string variable into multiple vars.

Usage:

count =
sys.split_string(\<spflags\>,\<string\>,\<avararray\>,\<delimstr\>);

Arguments:

integer \<spflags\> - Either SP_DEFAULT or any combination of

- SP_NOQUOTE - Treat single or double quotes as normal characters
- SP_NOSTRIP - Do not strip out empty values. This is important when
  position in the string is important.
- SP_PRESERVEQUOTE - Preserve outer single or double quotes. Only
  meaningful when SP_NOQUOTE ia not specified.

alpha \<string\> - The string to split.

alpha \<avararray\> - This should be the first member of a dimensioned
var.

alpha \<delimstr\> - A string made up of the characters you want to use
to determine where to split the string.

Returns:

integer \<count\> - The number of strings stored in \<avararray\>

Where Used:

sys.split_string() can be called from anywhere.

Example:

n = sys.split_string(SP_DEFAULT,"abc,def,xyz",avar\[0\],",");\
Assuming avar has a dimension of 10, this call will set n to 3,
avar\[0\] to "abc", avar\[1\] to "def", and avar\[2\] to "xyz".
avar\[3\] - avar\[9\] will each be set to "".

Description:

sys.split_string() splits a string into one or more strings and stores
the resuting strings in a dimensioned variable. The splitting occurs at
any character that matches one of the characters in \<delimstr\>. The
character matched is not saved.\
By default single and double quotes are special and any delimeters
inside of a quoted part of the string do not cause the string to split.
To avoid this special treatment of single and double quotes, specify
SP_NOQUOTE in \<spflags\>.\
Quotes act kind of odd when they are at the start of a split word.
Unless SP_PRESERVEQUOTE is specified, quotes at the start of a split are
stripped and the ending quote is stripped also and it also acts like a
delimeter.\
Empty values are stripped out by default. To avoid this and have empty
strings returned in in the avarray specify SP_NOSTRIP in \<spflags\>.

Requirements

sys.split_string() requires the 4c server to be at version 4.4.4 or
higher.

SP_NOSTRIP and SP_PRESERVEQUOTE require 4csrvr to be at version 5.2 or
higher
