## sys.start_busy()
### Purpose
sys.start_busy() starts a progress bar on the client.

### Usage
```c
sys.start_busy(<name>,<title>,<label>,<flags>);
```

### Arguments
\<name\> - an alpha that can be used to reference this progress bar in subsequent calls to `sys.stop_busy()` and `sys.set_busy()`

\<title\> - The text to display as the title.

\<label\> - The text to display as the label.

\<flags\> - and integer argument that consists of any of the following ored together.

- SB_DEFAULT - same as SB_TITLE|SB_LABEL|SB_NOCANCEL|SB_PROGRESS|SB_STATUS
- SB_TITLE, SB_NOTITLE
- SB_LABEL, SB_NOLABEL
- SB_CANCEL, SB_NOCANCEL
- SB_PROGRESS, SB_NOPROGRESS
- SB_STATUS, SB_NOSTATUS
- SB_OK, SB_NONOOK
- SB_FOCUS, SB_NOFOCUS

### Returns
This pcl should always return 0.

### Where Used
sys.start_busy() can be called from anywhere.

### Example
None

### Description
This system pcl causes a progress bar to start on the client's display if one with the same name is not already there. The progress bar will stop automatically when the program that started it either exits or needs user input on a field or at end page. The application can stop the progress bar by itself by calling `sys.stop_busy()`. If the user cancels on the progress bar, the program that started the progress bar as well as all pushed programs will exit with a -3 code. This is why cancel is not used in SB_DEFAULT.

### Bugs / Features / Comments
If the status area is present on a progress bar, `sys.msg()` output goes there.
