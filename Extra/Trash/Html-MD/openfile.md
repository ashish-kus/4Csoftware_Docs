sys.open_file()

### sys.open_file()

Purpose:

sys.open_file() allows you to open a file before it is needed for file
access.

Usage:

sys.open_file(\<asfile\>,\<flags\>);

Arguments:

asfile \<asfile\> - The asfile name of the file to open.

integer \<flags\> - Open flags. These can be or'd together with '\|'.
Possible values for the flags are:

- F_DEFAULT - Read/Write, NoCreate
- F_CREATE - Create the file.
- F_TEMP - Create and open a temporary file that will be deleted when it
  is closed.
- F_NOMSG - Do not display open error messages.
- F_READONLY - Open the file in readonly mode.
- F_NOREADONLY - Open the file in Read/Write mode. This is the default
  and does not normally need to be specified.
- F_TRANS
- F_NOTRANS
- F_SAVEBUF
- F_NOSAVEBUF
- F_BINARY - Open the file in binary mode. See the bootstrap program
  sys.file.xfer for how to access a file in binary mode.
- F_NODROP - With external databases, if F_CREATE is specified with
  F_NODROP, then truncate the table rather then dropping it and
  recreating it. There was a performance improvement with Oracle using
  this when the table was created a lot of times.

Returns:

0 - File opened OK.

-1 - Some Error

Where Used:

sys.open_file() can be called from anywhere. It most likely will be used
when you want to create a file if it does not yet exist, or to determine
existence of a file before you try to do something to it.

Example:

The bootstrap program sys.ph.maint uses the following code in the
edittext() pcl. It assumes that if the text file does not exist it
should create it.\
\


    if (sys.open_file(sys.pcl_text,F_DEFAULT|F_NOMSG) < 0)
        sys.open_file(sys.pcl_text,F_CREATE);

Description:

sys.open_file() allows you to open files before they are automatically
opened at file access time. If the asfile is already opened, possibly
under a different ext name, it will be closed first. If the F_TEMP flag
is specified, a temporary file is created. You do not need to specify
both F_TEMP and F_CREATE. If the F_CREATE flag is specified without
F_TEMP, then the file is created in the first directory of the data
path. If neither F_CREATE nor F_TEMP are specified, then F_DEFAULT is
assumed. This just opens the file. The F_SAVEBUF flag is used to specify
that 4C saves the original field values after each read. You may want to
do this if you will be calling sys.rcd_changed() or if you will be
calling sys.upd_file() on many rcds that may not have changed. When
F_SAVEBUF is used, sys.upd_file() will not actually rewrite any rcds
that did not change. Error messages can be suppressed by using the
F_NOMSG flag. The F_TRANS and F_NOTRANS flags can be used to override
the default transaction logging for files that support this.\
\
If there is an error opening the file, sys.errno will be set to one of:

- ERR_FILENF - File Not Found.
- ERR_FILEPERM - The process does not have permission to open the file
  in the desired mode. This may be due to file permissions or because
  another process has opened the file without allowing sharing.
- ERR_REMCONN - The file is a remote file and there was some type of
  connection error.
- ERR_FILEISOPEN - Create file failed because the file is open.
- ERR_UNKNOWN - Unknown error

Bugs/Features/Comments:

sys.open_file() does not set sys.errno for external database files.
