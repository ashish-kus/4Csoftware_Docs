### sys.close_file()

sys.close_file() closes a file.

Usage:

sys.close_file(\<asfile\>,\[\<closeflags\>\]);

Arguments:

asfile \<asfile\> - The asfile name of the file to close.

integer \<closeflags\> - Optional argument that can be a combination of
the following flags:

- F_CLOSEDEFAULT - Normal close
- F_CLOSECONN - Close the connection to the external file server or the
  external database if this file has a connection open.
- F_CLOSECURSOR - Indicate that sequential processing of an sql stmt is
  done and that the connection may now be closable

Returns:

0 - sys.close_file() always returns 0.

Where Used:

sys.close_file() can be called from anywhere.

Example:

Description:

sys.close_file() will close a file if it is open. If it is a temporary
file, it will be removed.

Bugs/Features/Comments:

It is not usually necessary for the application to call sys.close_file()
because 4C manages opens and closes as needed. One place that it may be
helpful though is in forcing the close of a remote file server or
external database connection. The F_CLOSECONN flag is used for that
purpose.
