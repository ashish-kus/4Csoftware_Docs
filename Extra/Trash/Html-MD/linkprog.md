sys.link_prog()

### sys.link_prog()

Purpose:

sys.link_prog() starts or links to a currently running program.

Usage:

sys.link_prog(\[\<linkflags\>\],\<progname\>\[,Arg1-Arg15\]); ret =
sys.link_prog(\[\<linkflags\]\>,\<progname\> \[,arg1 \[,..., \[arg15\]
\] ... \]);

Arguments:

linkflags - optional arg that can be either LP_DEFAULT or
LP_FROMANCESTOR

progname - alpha

arg1,arg2,...,arg15 0-15 optional alpha args that have meaning to the
called program.

Returns:

\- OK - program ran - and has exited or linked back

-1 - Err - Could not run program

Where Used:

sys.link_prog() usually is only used in screen programs.

Example:

See the calls to sys.link_prog in the program development bootstraps.
Especially note how LP_FROMANCESTOR is used in sys.df.fm.pnl and
sys.df.fm.def. The LP_FROMANCESTOR in these two programs makes the
sys.link_prog act like the link was made fromn sys.df.maint1.

Description:

sys.link_prog() starts a program that is a sibling of the currently
running program. The program started by sys.link_prog does not need to
exit before returning to the program that called it. In screen programs,
linking back to a program can be accomplished using the mouse or
function keys. The application can also link back with another call to
sys.link_prog(). The flag LP_FROMANCESTOR causes 4C to look search
through the heirarchy of currently pushed programs for one that
explicitly defines the program being called in it's Call/Share. If
found, the new program is linked to this program rather than the
currently running program. This is useful when nested programs may want
to link to the same instance of a program rather than start a new
instance. This flag is used in the bootstrap display field definitions
sys.df.fm.pnl and sys.df.fm.def to link to the other development
programs.
