## What is System PCL ?

System PCL refers to the built-in, core procedures provided by the 4C runtime environment that allow applications to interact directly with the system. These functions are prefixed with sys. and handle essential operations such as file access, record locking, transaction control, screen and UI management, encryption, logging, networking, and process control. Unlike user-written PCLs, System PCLs are part of the platform itself and are precompiled into the server, serving as the foundational API that all 4C application logic relies on.
