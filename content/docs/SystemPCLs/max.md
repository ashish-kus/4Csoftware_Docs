## max()
### Purpose
max() returns the maximum float/integer of its arguments.

### Usage
maxval = max(<arg1> [,<arg2> [..., [<arg16>]] ...]);

### Arguments
float <arg1>-<arg16> - The numerics to compare and get the max of.

### Returns
float <maxval> - The maximum of all passed args.

### Where Used
max() can be called from anywhere.

### Example
None

### Description
max() returns the maximum float/integer of its arguments. max() can be used with integers, dates, times, and floats.  
Arguments can be passed as integers/dates/times instead of floats because 4C will do the numeric conversions.  
This type conversion works on returns also.

### Bugs / Features / Comments
Prior to 4C Server version 4.4.7 max() is not reliable. Do not use max() unless your server is version 4.4.7 or higher.  
Prior to 4C Server version 4.4.7, max() only works with float args. You will get a compile error if you try to use it with other types of args.
