sys.dr_restart()

### sys.dr_restart()

Purpose:

sys.dr_restart() restarts a driver

Usage:

ret = sys.dr_restart(\[\<drfile\>\],\<flags\>);

Arguments:

asfile \<drfile\> - The asfile name of the driver to restart

integer \<flags\> - restart flags. The only possible values for the
flags are:


         DR_APPEND
         DR_CLEAR
         

Returns:

This System PCL should not return. If it does the return is -1 and means
that the specified driver was not running.

Where Used:

sys.dr_restart() can be called any time while the driver is running.\
\
One likely reason to restart a driver is to allow the user to select
more rcds than were originally selected for display.

Example:

sys.dr_restart(DR_CLEAR);\
\
This will restart the current driver clearing all rcds already selected.
The DrInit PCL will be able to specify sort fields as well as new
include fields.\
\
sys.dr_restart(sys.program,DR_APPEND);\
\
This will restart the sys.program driver and append rcds to the select
file. The DrInit PCL will not be able to specify new sort fields or
include fields.

Description:

sys.dr_restart() will restart the specified driver. If successfull, all
states nested within the driver will be exited. This means that any
nested drivers, pcls, or fields will exited. You can restart program
drivers as well as non program drivers. When a driver is restarted, the
DrInit PCL will be re-executed. If DR_CLEAR is specified, then you can
change any of the parameters of the DrInit. You can change sortby
fields, and include fields. If DR_APPEND is specified, then 4C forces
these values to maintain their original values.\
\
You can always specify the order to read the driver file by as well as
the window of rcds to select.\
\
When DR_APPEND is specified and you reselect rcds that were previously
selected, they are re-written into the driver sort file, replacing the
original.
