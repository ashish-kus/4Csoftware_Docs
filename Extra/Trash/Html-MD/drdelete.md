sys.dr_delete()

### sys.dr_delete()

Purpose:

sys.dr_delete() deletes one rcd from the tmp driver file

Usage:

sys.dr_delete();

Arguments:

None

Returns:

0 - OK

-1 - Error

Where Used:

sys.dr_delete() can be called by an application that is doing it's own
\<delete\> processing. It should not be called by an application that is
using default 4C delete processing.

Example:

The bootstrap program, sltree.fm, does it's own delete processing since
sometimes deleting a single entry needs to delete more than one driver
rcd.

Description:

An scrolling 4C program that does it's own processing for delete, will
need to call sys.dr_delete() in order to delete appropriate rcds from
the tmp driver file. The fields in main driver file need to have the
correct values set in order for sys.dr_delete() to work correctly.
sys.dr_delete() deletes only 1 rcd from the tmp driver file. It does not
delete anything from any other files.

Requirements

sys.dr_delete() requires 4CSrvr version 4.6.1 or higher.

Bugs/Features/Comments:

This is a fairly specialized SysPCL. Be sure your application needs it
before using it.

sys.dr_delete() will fail if you have changed any of the sort fields in
the main driver file. Not sure if this can or should be fixed or not.
