sh()

### sh()

Purpose:

sh() starts a copy of the shell to run a command.

Usage:

ret = sh(\<cmd\>); or\
ret = sh();

Arguments:

\<cmd\> - The cmd to run, including all arguments. The arguments and the
command name must be separated by spaces.

The \<cmd\> argument is optional, and if not used, an interactive copy
of the shell is started. This can be useful for a menu entry.

Returns:

0 - 255 - The exit status of the shell.

-1 - Error starting shell or shell terminated with a signal.

Where Used:

sh() can be called from anywhere.

Example:


    cmd = "xled sys.pcl_stmt " + sys.ph_prname + ' ' + sys.ph_pclname;
    sh(cmd);

Description:

sh() starts a copy of the shell to run a command. If arguments are
passed to sh(), they are assumed to make up a command. The shell will be
started with the '-c' option, passing all arguments to the shell to
parse. If no arguments are passed to sh(), then an interactive copy of
the shell is started. Which shell is used depends on the environment
variable 'SHELL'. If not set, then '/bin/sh' is started. It is better to
use sh() to run a command than sys.make_task() because you do not need
to know the absolute path name of the command to run. The shell will use
the 'PATH' environment variable.
