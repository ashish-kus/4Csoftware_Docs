## sys.cl_open()
### Purpose
sys.cl_open() opens or processes a file on the client machine using the appropriate client program.

### Usage
```c
ret = sys.cl_open(<path>,<opentype>[|CL_NOWAIT][|CL_NOCONVERT][|CL_NOEXPAND]);
```

### Arguments
alpha \<path\> - Full pathname of the file on the client machine.

integer \<opentype\> - Currently, this can be one of:

- CL_OPEN
- CL_EDIT
- CL_EXPLORE
- CL_PRINT

Any of the above types can be ored with 1 or more of CL_NOWAIT, CL_NOCONVERT, and CL_NOEXPAND.

### Returns
- -1 - Error. Possibly client version \< 4.2.0. Other errors from the client should generate messages.
- 0 - File opened/processed on client.

### Where Used
sys.cl_open() can be called from anywhere.

### Example
In order to open an html file in a browser, the following may work:
```c
sys.cl_open("c:/tmp/index.html",CL_OPEN);
```
You can also run the demo program, demo.clopen.1, to see other possibilities.

### Description
sys.cl_open() is used to allow the client machine's shell to process a file request. The client machine's shell determines the program to use and where the program is located. Different file extensions will have different meanings. In some cases CL_OPEN and CL_EDIT may do the same thing and in other cases they won't. The 4C client does not wait for the client program to exit. However, if the client program creates a window, it will get the focus. If it does not create a window, then you should specify CL_NOWAIT as part of the opentype parameter.

When opening a file on a Win32 client, the 4C Client will normally convert backslashes to forward slashes. When opening any type of URL this conversion is not done. You can explicitly avoid this type of conversion by specifying CL_NOCONVERT in the sys.cl_open() statement.

If the client is at version 4.8.0 or higher it will expand environment variables on the client. The env vars should be specified as \${ENVVAR} in the path. You can prevent this expansion by specifying CL_NOEXPAND with the flags argument.

Requirements

CL_NOCONVERT requires both client and server to be at version 4.6.3 or higher.

CL_NOEXPAND requires the 4c server to be at version 4.8.0 or higher.

Only clients at version 4.8.0 or higher will expand env vars embedded in \<path\>.
