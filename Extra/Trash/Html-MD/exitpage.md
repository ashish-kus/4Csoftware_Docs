sys.exit_page()

### sys.exit_page()

Purpose:

sys.exit_page() sets the next driver state of the program driver to be
STARTPAGE.

Usage:

retcode = sys.exit_page();\
\
or\
\
sys.exit_page();

Arguments:

None

Returns:

0 - Normal return

-1 - Program is not a scrolling program

Where Used:

sys.exir_page() can be called only while there is a a program driver
being processed. The program driver should be past the DRSSELEOF state.

Example:

if (newcode != oldcode) { sys.exit_page(); return;\
}

Description:

sys.exit_page() is used to change the driver state of the program
driver. The next state is set to be STARTPAGE. All current executing
PCLs will continue executing until finished. The next action started by
the program driver will be to run the SPagePCL. It only makes sense to
call this PCL during the DrProcPCL or during the printing of the current
record. If called from anywhere else, the driver state does not change.\
\
If called from the DrProcPCL, the record will not print on the current
logical page. It will print on the next logical page. The DrProcPCL will
execute twice for the same record when sys.exit_page() is called from
there.\
\
You may want to call sys.exit_page() in order to get your program to
print differently than the normal 4C way. This could mean organizing
several logical pages on the same page, each with headers, or forcing a
page break when some values change or something like that.\
\
The only difference between sys.end_page() and sys.exit_page() is that
sys.end_page() will execute the EPagePCL before entering the next
StartPage driver state. sys.exit_page() does not execute the EPagePCL
before entering the StartPage driver state.

Bugs/Features/Comments:

There is no check to make sure that the program driver is past the
DRSELEOF state.\
\
When sys.dr_exitpage() is called from the DRPROC PCL, this rcd will be
processed twice and the DRPROC PCL will be run twice on this rcd. It is
better to avoid calling sys.dr_exitpage() from the DRPROC PCL. Call it
from one of the CB PCLS and no PCL will be executed twice for the same
rcd.
