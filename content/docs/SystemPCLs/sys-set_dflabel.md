## sys.set_dflabel()
### Purpose
sys.set_dflabel() changes the label associated with a display field.

### Usage
```c
ret = sys.set_dflabel(<dflabel>,<newlabel>);
```

### Arguments
integer - `<dflabel>` - This should be the DFLABEL of the display field.

alpha - `<newlabel>` - The new label.

### Returns
integer `<ret>`

0 - OK

< 0 - Invalid `<dflabel>`, or cur program is not a screen program

### Where Used
sys.set_dflabel() can be called from any screen program that is open. You can not call sys.set_dflabel() in the InitPCL.

### Example
None

### Description
sys.set_dflabel() changes the label of a 4C display field. The display field must have a label associated with it at compile time. sys.set_dflabel() works with any field that has a side label or top label. The total length of the label is never changed.

### Bugs / Features / Comments
The original label should be as long as or longer than any new label that you will use for that dfield. Otherwise it may be truncated, or in some cases completely hidden, when changed.
