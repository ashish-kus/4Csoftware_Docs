## sys.put_afield()
### Purpose
sys.put_afield() stores an alpha value in an alpha field by name.

### Usage
```c
ret = sys.put_afield([<asprog>], <asfilename>, <fieldname>, <aval>);
```

### Arguments
asprog `<asprog>` - The asprog name of the program to use to find `<asfilename>` and `<fieldname>`. This is an optional argument, and if not used, the current program is assumed.

alpha `<asfilename>` - The asfile name of the file containing `<fieldname>`. This must be passed in quotes, or in an alpha variable.

alpha `<fieldname>` - The name of the field you want to store the value. This must be passed in quotes, or in an alpha variable. Dimesioned variables can be used also using a format like "field[n]".

alpha `<aval>` - The alpha value to store in `<fieldname>`.

### Returns
0 - OK - `<aval>` stored in `<fieldname>`

-1 - Error - Either `<asprog>` or `<asfilename>` or `<fieldname>` is invalid.

### Where Used
sys.put_afield() can be called from anywhere. It may be used in report/screen writers that do not know what fields they are using until runtime.

### Example
None

### Description
sys.put_afield() locates the field identified by `<fieldname>` and stores `<aval>` in it. sys.put_afield() is meant to be used when you don't know the field to store into until runtime.

### Bugs / Features / Comments
If `<fieldname>` is not an alpha type, no error is indicated, but no value is stored either.
