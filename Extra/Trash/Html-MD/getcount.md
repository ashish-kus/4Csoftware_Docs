sys.get_count()

### sys.get_count()

Purpose:

sys.get_count() returns the current count of CB Selected rcds for a CB
Var/EOF Group for a particular CB.

Usage:


    count = sys.get_count();
    count = sys.get_count(<cbvar>);
    count = sys.get_count(<CBNAME>,<cbvar>);



              Or more generally



    count = sys.get_count([[<CBNAME>,]<cbvar>]);

\
\
In most cases, sys.get_count() will be used without arguments. When used
this way, it will work with the current CB and the current CB Var/EOF
Group.\
\
Arguments are allowed so that you can get rcd counts without needing to
be processing a particular CB Var Group or even a particular CB.

Arguments:

\<CBNAME\> - The name of the CB that you need to get the count for. This
is an optional argument. If it is not passed, then sys.get_count() uses
the current CB. If it is passed, then the \<cbvar\> argument must also
be passed.

\<cbvar\> - The fldname that defines the CB Var Group that you want the
rcd count for. This is an optional argument as long as the \<CBNAME\>
argument is not used. If \<cbvar\> is not used, then sys.get_count()
returns the rcd count for the current CB Var/EOF Group for the current
CB.

Returns:

-1 - Either \<CBNAME\> or \<cbvar\> is invalid.

\>= 0 - The current count of CB Selected rcds for specified CB and CB
Var Group.

Where Used:

sys.get_count() can be called from anywhere as long as there is an
active driver with \<CBNAME\> set appropriately to either CB_DRPROC or
CB_DRSEL.

Example:

The following example could be used to skip the CB EOF processing if no
records have been CB Selected. Assume that this call is made from the CB
EOF PCL. No arguments are passed, and sys.get_count() returns the total
count of records CB Selected for the CB EOF Group of the current CB.\
\
if (sys.get_count() == 0) sys.exit_cb();\
\
The next example could be used to skip the printing of totals if only 1
record has been CB Selected. Assume that this call is made from Any CB
Var Group PCL. No arguments are passed, and sys.get_count() returns the
count of records CB Selected for the current CB Var Group of the current
CB.\
\
if (sys.get_count() \> 1) printtots();

Description:

sys.get_count() returns the current count of CB Selected rcds for a CB
Var/EOF Group for a particular CB. It can be called with 0, 1, or 2
arguments.\
\
If called with 0 arguments, then the current count of CB Selected rcds
for the Current CB Var/EOF Group of the current CB is returned.\
\
If used with 1 arg, the arg is \<cbvar\>. sys.get_count() will return
the count of CB Selected rcds for the specified CB Var Group for the
current CB. You may want to use sys.get_count() in this manner if you
need to access a CB Var Group rcd count for the current CB outside of
the current CB Var Group.\
\
If used with 2 args, the args are CBNAME and \<cbvar\>. sys.get_count()
will return the count of CB Selected rcds for the specified CB Var for
the specified CB. You may want to use sys.get_count() in this manner if
you need to access a CB Var Group rcd count of any CB outside of the
processing for that CB.\
\
Thus, you can get any rcd count for any CB Var Group for any currently
active CB from any PCL.\
\
In order to get a CB EOF rcd count outside of the CB EOF Group
processing, you need to call sys.get_gcount() instead of
sys.get_count().\
\
4C maintains rcd counts for each CB Var group and for the CB EOF Group.
These rcd counts are updated at the same time that totals are updated.
That is, the rcd counts are updated after the rcd has been CB Selected
and before running the DRSELECT or DRPROC PCL. After a CB is processed,
the rcd counts of all CB Var Groups at the same or lower level than the
triggering group are set back to zero. The rcd counts of higher level CB
Var Groups and of the CB EOF Group are not modified.
