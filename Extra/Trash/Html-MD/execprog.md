Example:

Description:

sys.exec_prog() starts a program that runs in place of the currently
running program. sys.exec_prog() is similar to sys.link_prog() because
the execed program runs on the same level as the current program. The
differences are that with sys.exec_prog(), control never returns to the
current program. sys.exec_prog() can be used to restart the current
program.
