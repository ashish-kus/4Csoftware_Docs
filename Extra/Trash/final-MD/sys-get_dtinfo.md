## sys.get_dtinfo()
### Purpose
`sys.get_dtinfo()` returns date, time, and timestamp info for the passed in date and times.

### Usage
```c
rc = sys.get_dtinfo(<dtiasfile>,<date>,<time>,<dttype>);
```

### Arguments
asfile `<dtiasfile>` - The asfile for `sys.dt_info` that receives the timestamp info.

date - `<date>` - The date to return info for

time - `<time>` - The time to return info for

integer `<dttype>` - The type of date and time passed in. This must be one of `DTTYPE_LOCAL` or `DTTYPE_UTC`. `DTTYPE_GMT` is a synonym for `DTTYPE_UTC`.

### Returns
0 - Info returned

-1 - Error

### Where Used
`sys.get_dtinfo()` can be called from anywhere.

### Example
None

### Description
`sys.get_dtinfo()` returns date, time, and timestamp info for a single UTC or local date and time. The info is returned in the fields of a `sys.dt_info` asfile. See the file definition for `sys.dt_info` for more info.

### Bugs / Features / Comments
When time is switching between daylight time and standard time, the same date and time can have 2 different valid timestamps, one using DT and one using ST. When this is the case the `dti_alttimestamp` will have the alternate timestamp. An example for this is the 2020-11-01 anytime between 1:00:00am and 1:59:59am for any USA location that uses daylight savings time.

When time is switching between standard time and daylight time, there is one hour that does not really exist but `sys.get_dtinfo()` will return the info for that date and time as if it did exist but the fields in the `sys.dt_info` file will have the correct date and time on return. An example of this is 2020-03-08 anytime between 2:00:00am and 2:59:59am for any USA location that uses daylight savings time.
