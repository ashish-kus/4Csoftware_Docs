sys.set_pnlimage()

### sys.set_pnlimage()

Purpose:

sys.set_pnlimage() changes the background image of a panel.

Usage:

ret = sys.set_pnlimage(\<pnlcdef\>,\<imagepath\>);

Arguments:

integer \<pnlcdef\> - The CDefine for the panel.

alpha \<imagepath\> - The path to the image. This can be either a full
pathname on the server, a relative pathname from the FC_IMAGE directory
on the server, or a url.

Returns:

integer \<ret\>

0 - OK

\< 0 - Invalid \<pnlcdef\>, or cur program is not a screen program

Where Used:

sys.set_pnlimage() can be called from any screen program that is open.
You can not call sys.set_pnlimage() in the InitPCL.

Example:

See the demo.image.5 and demo.tile.1 demo programs for examples of using
sys.set_pnlimage().

Description:

sys.set_pnlimage() changes the background image of a 4C panel. The panel
must have image info associated with it at compile time. Other than the
path, this image info can not change during run time.

Bugs/Features/Comments:

Any program that uses sys.set_pnlimage() should always initialize any of
the images that may change in the "Open" pcl to the default image that
you want displayed. Otherwise that last image set may be displayed the
next time the program is run if the layout is still running.
