## sys.mk_temp()
### Purpose
`sys.mk_temp()` returns a fullpath name that can be used to create a temporary file.

### Usage
```c
fullpath = sys.mktemp(<fnstart> [, <dirname>]);
```

### Arguments
alpha `<fnstart>` - The starting chars to use for the basename.

alpha `<dirname>` - Optional directory to use instead of `${FC_TEMP}`.

### Returns
alpha `<fullpath>` - The fullpath name that can be used as a temporary file.

### Where Used
`sys.mk_temp()` can be called from anywhere.

### Example
The 4cSys global PCL, `sys.app_trace()`, uses `sys.mk_temp()` to find a name to be used in creating a uniq trace file. It passes in "trc" as the `<fnstart>` argument so the return will be the fullpath name to the FC_TEMP dir followed by "/tr-<pid>.<ext>" where `<pid>` is an 8 digit process id of the calling 4csrvr and `<ext>` is a uniq extension.

### Description
Use `sys.mk_temp()` when you may need to create a uniq temporary file. `sys.mk_temp()` does not create the file, it just returns a fullpath that at the time of call did not exist in the filesystem and the caller should be able to create a file with that name. `sys.mk_temp()` always uses the FC_TEMP directory for the beginning of the fullpath name returned.
