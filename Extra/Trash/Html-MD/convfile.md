sys.conv_file()

### sys.conv_file()

Purpose:

sys.conv_file() converts data from the fields of one file to the fields
of another.

Usage:

sys.conv_file(\<fromasfile\>,\<toasfile\>);

Arguments:

asfile \<frmoasfile\> - The asfile name of the file to convert from.

asfile \<toasfile\> - The asfile name of the file to convert to.

Returns:

None

Where Used:

sys.conv_file() can be called from anywhere.

Example:

The bootstrap program sys.prog.exp.1 uses sys.conv_file() in writing the
sys.prog_exp file. Here is the code that converts a sys.dpy_field.x rcd
to a sys.prog_exp rcd.\
\


    /*
     * Add one rcd to sys.prog_exp using
     * the sys.dpy_field.x rcd
     */
    copydf();
    sys.read_file(sys.prog_exp,F_ADD);
    sys.conv_file(dfx,sys.prog_exp);
    sys.upd_file(sys.prog_exp);

Description:

sys.conv_file() can be used to convert one rcd format to another. 4C
does this conversion by first blocking the \<fromasfile\> into a rcd
buffer as if it were going to write it, but without writing it. It then
deblocks that rcd as if the \<toasfile\> had just read it. The 2 rcd
formats need to be compatible. Thus it is possible to convert a FixSeq
rcd with 2 x(16) fields to a FixSeq rcd with 1 x(32) field.

Bugs/Features/Comments:

You MUST make sure that the record layouts being converted are
compatible.
