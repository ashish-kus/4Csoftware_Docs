## sys.browse_file()
### Purpose
`sys.browse_file()` allows you to browse through rcds sequentially.

### Usage
```c
sys.browse_file(<asfile>, <fldcdef>);
```

### Arguments
asfile `<asfile>` - The asfile name of the file to browse.

integer `<fldcdef>` - The CDEFINE of the field to browse by. This field MUST be part of a key, primary or secondary.

### Returns
None

### Where Used
`sys.browse_file()` is normally called from the `<keyup>` or `<keydown>` PCL for an input display field.

### Example
In the system development program, browsing on the `sys.pr_name` field is enabled by defining a PCL for `<keyup>` and for `<keydown>`. The PCL defined is:
```c
sys.browse_file(sys.program,S_PRNAME);
```

### Description
When called, `sys.browse_file()` initiates sequential reading of the specified file at the rcd closest to the current value of the key being used. The user interacts with `sys.browse_file()` by pressing the `<keyup>` or `<keydown>` keys to browse next or previous rcd, or by pressing the `<return>` key to accept current selection.

All keyfields that come before the field specified by `<fldcdef>` will be left unchanged. The keyfields beginning with `<fldcdef>` may be changed by `sys.browse_file()`, as well as any other fields that are not part of the key being used to read the file.

### Bugs / Features / Comments
Cancelling out of browse does not restore fields to their original values.  
No secondary files can be read.  
There should be a more automatic way of enabling browsing.
