sys.field_wasinp()

### sys.field_wasinp()

Purpose:

sys.field_wasinp() indicates whether the current field allowed input
from the user or not.

Usage:

if (sys.field_wasinp()) dosomething();

Arguments:

None

Returns:

0 - Current field did not allow input for some reason.\
\
This could be because sys.end_field() was called from the FldSfld PCL,
the field is display only, Accept was entered on a field preceding this
field, Ftab was entered on a field preceding this field, or a scrolling
program is in column modify mode on a different field.

1 - The current field allowed input\
\
This does not necesarily mean that anything was input, only that the
user was prompted for input. The user could have entered \<CR\> only and
the return will still be 1.

-1 - There is no current field.

Where Used:

sys.field_wasinp() can be called only during FIELD processing.

Example:


    /*
         This is an example from the bootstrap
         program sys.df.maint1
         


         End field PCL for sys.df_litflag
         


         If no input was allowed on this field,
         do not push the lit maint program
    */
    if (sys.field_wasinp() == 0)
         return;


    sys.push_prog("sys.dflit.maint");

Description:

sys.field_wasinp() allows the user program to determine if the current
field allowed input or not. Mainly it is used to know whether a field
did not allow input because of forward tabbing, column modify mode, or
end of data. It is useful in determining whether other programs should
be pushed or not.\
\
It should only be called from the FldEfld PCL of any field.\
\
sys.field_wasinp() does not indicate what the user may have input, only
that input was allowed. The user could have entered \<CR\> or a function
key, and the return will still be 1.
