sys.mk_temp()

### sys.mk_temp()

Purpose:

sys.mk_temp() returns a fullpath name that can be used to create a
temporary file.

Usage:

fullpath = sys.mktemp(\<fnstart\> \[, \<dirname\> \]);

Arguments:

alpha \<fnstart\> - The starting chars to use for the basename.

alpha \<dirname\> - Optional directory to use instead of \${FC_TEMP}

Returns:

alpha \<fullpath\> - The fullpath name that can be used as a temporary
file.

Where Used:

sys.mk_temp() can be called from anywhere.

Example:

The 4cSys global PCL, sys.app_trace(), uses sys.mk_temp() to find a name
to be used in creating a uniq trace file. It passes in "trc" as the
\<fnstart\> argument so the return will be the fullpath name to the
FC_TEMP dir followed by "/tr-\<pid\>.\<ext\>" where \<pid\> is an 8
digit process id of the calling 4csrvr and \<ext\> is a uniq extension.

Description:

Use sys.mk_temp() when you may need to create a uniq temporary file.
sys.mk_temp() does not create the file, it just returns a fullpath that
at the time of call did not exist in the filesystem and the caller
should be able to create a file with that name. sys.mk_temp() always
uses the FC_TEMP directory for the beginning of the fullpath name
returned.

Requirements

4csrvr version 6.4.4 and later

The optional directory name is available on 4csrvr version 6.4.8 and
later
