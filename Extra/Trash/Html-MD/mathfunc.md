mathfunc()

### mathfunc()

Purpose:

mathfunc() Miscellaneous Math Functions

Following is a list of math functions implemented as system PCLs. Except
where indicated all results and arguments are 4C floats.

- result = pow(x,y);\


      returns x raised to the power of y.

- result = log(x);\


      returns the natural logarithm of x;

- result = log10(x);\


      returns the base 10 logarithm of x;

- result = exp(x);\


      returns the exponential function of x

- result = ldexp(x,y);\


      returns x * (2 raised to the y power)
      y is an integer

- result = sqrt(x);\


      returns the square root of x

- srand(x)\


      starts a new sequence of seudo random numbers using x as seed
      x is a non negative integer

- n = rand();\


      returns the next psuedo random integer
      n is a non negative integer <= 32767

- result = sin(x);\


      returns the sine of x

- result = sinh(x);\


      returns the hyperbolic sine of x

- result = cos(x);\


      returns the cosine of x

- result = cosh(x);\


      returns the hyperbolic cosine of x

- result = tan(x);\


      returns the tangent of x

- result = tanh(x);\


      returns the hyperbolic tangent of x

- result = atan(x);\


      returns the arc tangent of x

- result = atanh(x);\


      returns the inverse hyperbolic tangent of x

- result = acos(x);\


      returns the arc cosine of x

- result = asin(x);\


      returns the arc sine of x

- result = atan2(y,x);\


      returns the arc tangent of the two variables x and y.

- result = asinh(x);\


      returns the inverse hyperbolic sine of x

- result = acosh(x);\


      returns the inverse hyperbolic cosine of x

Where Used:

Any of the above math functions can be called from anywhere in the
application.

Bugs/Features/Comments:

All of the above functions are implemented using calls to standard C
library routines. 4C type floats are converted to C type double before
calling the routine. C type results of double are converted back to 4C
type floats. Because of this conversion, precision may be lost since the
C type double is less precise than the 4C type of float.
