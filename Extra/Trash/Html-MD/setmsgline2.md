sys.set_msgline2()

### sys.set_msgline2()

Purpose:

sys.set_msgline2() allows you to modify the 4C environment variable
XLMSGLINE2.

Usage:

sys.set_msgline2(\<msgline2\>);

Arguments:

integer \<msgline2\> - The line number to display fkey help messages on.
If non-positive, this is assumed to be relative to last line of the
screen.

Returns:

None

Where Used:

sys.set_msgline2() can be called from anywhere. It is most likely used
in system programs that allow the user to change their environment.

Example:

In the system program sys.help.set, the EndFld PCL for ok calls
sethelp() which in turn calls sys.set_msgline2() to set the user
specified value for XLMSGLINE2. The entire sethelp() PCL follows:\
\


    sys.set_help(helpmsg);
    sys.set_fkhelp(fkhelp);
    sys.set_msgline1(msgl1);
    sys.set_msgline2(msgl2);
    sys.set_return(retsel);

Description:

sys.set_msgline2() sets the value of the 4C environment variable
XLMSGLINE2. This env variable specifies the line number to display fkey
help messages. When \<= 0, 4C calculates the real line number relative
to the last line of the screen. Thus, for a 25 line screen, a value of
-2 set XLMSGLINE2 to 23.

Bugs/Features/Comments:

The values stored in the 4C Environment variables may be different than
those at the shell. Calls to sys.set_help() etc do not modify the
shell's environment, only 4C's internal copy. Even shells started from
4C will not share the same environment if the 4C environment has changed
during running.\

Of Course this is subject to change.
