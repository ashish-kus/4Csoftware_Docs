## sys.get_keyno()
### Purpose
`sys.get_keyno()` returns the keyno associated with a field.

### Usage
```c
keyno = sys.get_keyno(<asfile>,[ <field> | <fldcdef> ]);
```

### Arguments
- `<asfile>` asfilename - The asfile that `<field>` is in.
- `<field>` - A field in file `<asfile>`.
  
or

- `<fldcdef>` - The cdef of a field in `<asfile>`

### Returns
integer `<keyno>`

- `< 0` - Not a key field
- `>= 0` - The key number of the field. 0 ==> Primary key, 1 ==> first secondary, etc. The keyno returned is 1 less than that defined in the file definition.

### Where Used
`sys.get_keyno()` can be called from anywhere. It will normally be called so that the keyno can be passed to other system PCLs that expect it. In particular, a DrInit PCL that calls `sys.seek_key()` should call `sys.get_keyno()` instead of hardcoding the `<keyno>` argument.

### Example
In the system program, `sys.prmem.rpt1.1`, the DrInit PCL for `sys.program` sets the start and end key and then calls `sys.seek_key()`. `sys.seek_key()` expects a keynum argument, which is gotten by calling `sys.get_keyno`. Coding it this way allows for the keynum to change if you modify the file definition. The relevant code follows:

```c
else {
   sys.pr_name = sys.prm_fromprog;
   sys.set_skey(sys.program,S_PRNAME,MATCH_PARTIAL);
   sys.pr_name = sys.prm_toprog;
   sys.set_ekey(sys.program,S_PRNAME,MATCH_PARTIAL);
   sys.seek_key(sys.program,
               sys.get_keyno(sys.program,sys.pr_name),SEEK_START);
}
```

The `sys.seek_key()` statement could also be coded as:

```c
sys.seek_key(sys.program,
             sys.get_keyno(sys.program,S_PRNAME),SEEK_START);
```

This method is now the preferred method because it is consistent with the way most other SysPCLs refer to file variables.

### Description
`sys.get_keyno()` returns the keyno associated with `<field>` in `<asfile>`. This number is the internal representation which is one less than that defined in the file definition. Some system PCLs expect this keyno in this form. Especially `sys.seek_key()`. This PCL replaces the obsolete `$key_number()`.

### Bugs / Features / Comments
There is no real check to see if `<field>` is in file, so if it isn't, the results will be unpredictable.  
To be consistent with other PCLs that need a `<fldcdef>`, it is better to use the `<fldcdef>` than the `<field>` itself.  
It is unfortunate that the return does not match the key num field in the file definition.
