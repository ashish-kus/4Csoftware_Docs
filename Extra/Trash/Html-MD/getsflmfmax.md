sys.get_sflmfmax()

### sys.get_sflmfmax()

Purpose:

sys.get_sflmfmax() returns the max sfl mem fault value.

Usage:

sflmfmax = sys.get_sflmfmax();

Arguments:

None

Returns:

integer \<sflmfmax\> - The max amount memory allocated in non-shared
memory instead of shared memory because shared memory could not be
allocated when a file def was being read into shared memory.

Where Used:

sys.get_sflmfmax() can be called from anywhere. It is used in the system
program sys.mem.summary to help in configuring the system.\
\
This is meant for INTERNAL USE ONLY.

Example:

The following stmt is the StFld PCL for sflmfmax in the program
sys.mem.summary.\
\


    sflmfmax = sys.get_sflmfmax();

Description:

sys.get_sflmfmax() returns the max sfl mem fault value. This is the
maximum amount of memory allocated in non-shared memory instead of
shared memory at one time because shared memory was not available when a
file needed it. sfl stands for an internal structure named sys_file.

Bugs/Features/Comments:

If when running the sys.mem.summary program you usually have File Mem
Faults, you need to either increase the amount of system memory
specified in the XLCONFIG file, or lower the number of files.
