## sys.file_op()
### Purpose
sys.file_op() allows you to manipulate files on both the client and the server in a platform independent manner.

### Usage
```c
ret = sys.file_op(<cmd>,<flags>,<path1>[,<path2>]...);
```

### Arguments
\<cmd\> - One of
- FOP_COPY
- FOP_MOVE
- FOP_RENAME
- FOP_DELETE
- FOP_CREATEDIR
- FOP_CREATEFILE
- FOP_DELETEDIR
- FOP_DELETEFILE
- FOP_TESTEXIST
- FOP_TESTDIR
- FOP_TESTFILE
- FOP_TESTDIREMPTY
- FOP_TRUNCATE
- FOP_SIZE32

\<flags\> - Any combination of
- FOP_DEFAULT
- FOP_CLIENT - Specify this in order to manipulate files on the client PC.
- FOP_SILENT
- FOP_VERBOSE
- FOP_FORCE
- FOP_RECURSIVE

\<path1\>,...\<pathN\> - One or more file/directory paths. The meaning and correct number of path arguments depends on \<cmd\>.

### Returns
integer \<ret\> -
0 - OK, No Error/False
1 - No Error/True
\< 0 - Error, and sys.errno will be set appropriately.

### Where Used
sys.file_op() can be called from anywhere.

### Example
The demo.fileop.1 program in the demo application shows how to use sys.file_op().

### Description
sys.file_op() allows the application to manipulate files on either the client or the server in a platform independent manner. The commands available and they way they operate are
- FOP_COPY - Copy one or more files to another file or directory. Requires at least 2 \<path\> args. If more than 2 \<path\> args are specified, then the last one must be an existing directory. Returns 0 if copy succeeded, -1 otherwise.
- FOP_MOVE - Requires at least 2 \<path\> args. If more than 2 \<path\> args are specified, then the last one must be an existing directory. Returns 0 if move succeeded, -1 otherwise.
- FOP_RENAME - Rename a file or directory. Requires exactly 2 \<path\> args. Returns 0 if rename succeeded, -1 otherwise.
- FOP_DELETE - Delete one or more files/directories. Allows any number of \<path\> args up to maximum of 14. If deleting a directory, then it must be empty unless the FOP_RECURSIVE flage is set. Returns 0 if delete succeeds, -1 otherwise.
- FOP_CREATEDIR - Create a single directory. Requires exactly one arg. If \<path1\> does not exist it is created as a directory. If FOP_FORCE is specified \<path1\> is recursively removed before attempting the create. Any needed higher level directories will be created as well. Returns 0 if create succeeds, -1 otherwise.
- FOP_CREATEFILE - Create a single file. Requires exactly one arg. If \<path1\> does not exist it is created as an empty file. If FOP_FORCE is specified \<path1\> is recursively removed before attempting the create. Any needed higher level directories will be created as well. Returns 0 if create succeeds, -1 otherwise.
- FOP_DELETEDIR - Delete directory. Requires exactly one arg. Returns 0 if delete succeeds, -1 otherwise.
- FOP_DELETEFILE - Delete file. Requires exactly one arg. Returns 0 if delete succeeds, -1 otherwise.
- FOP_TESTEXIST - Test for existence of \<path1\>. Requires exactly one arg. \<path1\> may be an existing file or directory. Return 0 if \<path1\> does not exist, 1 if it does, and -1 for error.
- FOP_TESTDIR - Test for existence of directory. Requires exactly one arg. Return 0 if \<path1\> does not exist, 1 if it does exist and is a directory, -1 for error.
- FOP_TESTFILE - Test for existence of file. Requires exactly one arg. Return 0 if \<path1\> does not exist, 1 if it does exist and is a file, -1 for error.
- FOP_TESTDIREMPTY - Test if \<path1\> is an empty directory. Requires exactly one arg. Return 0 if \<path1\> is a non empty directory, 1 if \<path1\> is an empty diretory, -1 for error.
- FOP_TRUNCATE - Truncate \<path1\>. Requires exactly one arg. \<path1\> must be an existing file. Return 0 if file truncated successfully, -1 for error.
- FOP_SIZE32 - Return size of \<path1\>. Requires exactly one arg. \<path1\> must be an existing file. Return the file size if file is accesible and size is \<= 2,147,483,647, -1 for error, FOP_SIZE32_OVERFLOW if the filesize is \> 2,147,483,647.

Any of the \<path\> arguments can be an environment variable that is expanded on the target machine before executing the operation. Use the \${ENVVAR} syntax to specify an envvar for a \<path\>.\
\<path\> arguments can also use the special '\*' character to indicate multiple filenames.\
When `sys.file_op()` returns -1, `sys.errno()` may be set to any of the following:
- FC_CMD_ERR - Invalid \<cmd\>.
- FC_ARG_ERR - Invalid number of arguments.
- FC_FILENF_ERR - One of \<pathN\> should exist, but doesn't.
- FC_FILEPERM_ERR - At least one of \<pathN\> could not be accessed due to permissions.
- FC_ISDIR_ERR - At least one of \<pathN\> should not exist as a directory, but does.
- FC_NOTDIR_ERR - At least one of \<pathN\> should exist as a directory, but doesn't.
- FC_NOTEMPTY_ERR - At least one of \<pathN\> is a directory that should be empty but is not.
- FC_NFILE_ERR - Too many open files.
- FC_FILEEXISTS_ERR - At least one of \<pathN\> should not exist but does.
- FC_UNKNOWN_ERR - Unknown error.
