sys.is_prog()

### sys.is_prog()

Purpose:

sys.is_prog() indicates if the \<asprog\> arg is a currently running 4C
program.

Usage:

ret = sys.is_prog(\<asprog\>);

Arguments:

asprog \<asprog\> - The 4C asprog name of the program

Returns:

0 - \<asprog\> is not currently running.

1 - \<asprog\> is currently running

Where Used:

sys.is_prog() can be called from anywhere. It is used in the 4C debugger
programs for verification. It could also be used to prevent multiple
copies of a program from being run.

Example:

The following example is from the 4C debugger program sys.dbg.fld. It is
the aspefld PCL. It is used in order to verify that \<asprog\> exists
before trying to display the fields in \<asprog\>.\
\


    if (sys.is_prog(asprog) == 0) {
        sys.err_msg("No Such Program:",asprog);
        sys.exit_field(sys.cur_field);
    }
    progname = sys.get_progname(asprog);

Description:

sys.is_prog() indicates if the \<asprog\> arg is a currently running 4C
program.

Bugs/Features/Comments:

There is no way to determine if more than one copy of \<asprog\> is
running. However, this could be added.
