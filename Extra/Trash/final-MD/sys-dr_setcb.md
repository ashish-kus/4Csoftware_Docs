## sys.dr_setcb()
### Purpose
sys.dr_setcb() activates a CB for either DRSELECT processing or for DRPROC processing.

### Usage
```c
sys.dr_setcb(cbname,flag);
```

### Arguments
integer cbname  
cbname is the name of a CB defined for this program.

integer flag  
flag can be CB_DRSEL or CB_DRPROC only

### Returns
0 - Normal

-1 - No such CB or Not in the DRINIT PCL of a driver.

### Where Used
sys.dr_setcb() can be called only from the DRINIT state.

### Example
```c
sys.dr_setcb(PROGRAM1,CB_DRPROC);
```

### Description
sys.dr_setcb() activates the specified CB for either DRSELECT processing or for DRPROC processing. This routine must be called in order to activate a CB for a driver. `sys.dr_setcb` can only be called from the DRINIT PCL of a driver. This routine can be called more than once in order to activate multiple CBs. When more than 1 CB are active, they are always processed in the same order as the `sys.dr_setcb()` calls. Also, they are completely independant of one another.

### Bugs / Features / Comments
Currently there is no automatic way of setting a CB for a driver. This should be added to the bootstraps.
